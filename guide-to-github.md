# Quick guide to using GitHub

In SDCA Research we use GitHub for common docs and support. This is a
quick guide to write your first (or second) content and contribute to
the community. Please be aware that everything on GitHub is **open
access**, so don't add anything private or confidential.

## First time logging in

1.  [Sign up](github.com/join) for a GitHub account if you don't have
    one already.

2.  Go to the SDCA Research GitHub
    [repository](https://github.com/steno-aarhus/research/).

    ![SDCA GitHub main page.](images/sdca-repo.png)

3.  Send your username to administrator Luke Johnston so he can add you
    as a team member.

4.  You'll receive an invitation mail. Join
    [\@steno-aarhus](https://github.com/steno-aarhus) through the link
    (expires in 7 days)

5.  Watch [tutorial
    videos](https://steno-aarhus.github.io/research/CONTRIBUTING.html)

## How to contribute?

1.  Create a new (personal) branch[^guide-to-github-1] to work in, since
    you can't directly edit the files in the "main" branch. (You need to
    be added as a teammember to complete this step)

[^guide-to-github-1]: A branch is a bit like a "copy" of the files in
    the "main" branch. After you edit the files in the "copy" (branch),
    you can request your changes get included into the main branch.

2.  If you want to add a new file, rather than modify and existing one,
    go to "Create new file":

3.  Give your file a name, for instance `guide-to-github.md` (only small
    characters and use `-` for spaces). Use `.md` as the file extension,
    which stands for "Markdown".

4.  Start writing your content in Markdown. You can find support on how
    to write using Markdown in the
    [tutorials](https://steno-aarhus.github.io/research/CONTRIBUTING.html)
    or in GitHub's guide on
    [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

5.  In order to save your changes you've made, you need to
    'commit'[^guide-to-github-2] this new file to the Git history and
    eventually on to the website. At the bottom of the page is a text
    box to write a message. Please write a short message describing why
    you are adding the files or making the changes.

[^guide-to-github-2]: "Commit" means to save something to the history,
    like you "commit" something to your memory.

6.  Now you can find your file in the research folder on your personal
    branch. You can continue writing either on this file or others by
    clicking the 'Edit' button of the file.

repository.](images/new-file-in-history.png)

files.](images/editting-file.png)

7.  Once you are finished with what you want to add or modify, the next
    step is to get the content on the website. To do that, you'll need
    to make a "pull request"[^guide-to-github-3] so that your content
    gets merged into the main branch. Go to 'Code', choose your personal
    branch, click 'Contribute' and 'Open pull request'.

[^guide-to-github-3]: A pull request is a process of taking your branch
    and requesting that it get merged into the main branch. It also
    allows for people to comment on your changes before they get merged.

![Creating a pull request.](images/create-pull-request.png)

8.  Once you've selected to make a pull request of your branch, you need
    to write a title describing what you are adding or changing and why.
    Then you can click 'Create pull request.'. The administrator will
    look at the pull request and if necessary, add some edits before
    adding it to the main branch/webpage. Everyone can comment with
    suggestion for change.

request.](images/submit-pull-request.png)

And that's the basics!
