# Guide to GitHub

In SDCA Research we use GitHub for common docs and support.  This is a quick guide to write your first (or second) content and contribute to the community. 
Please be aware that everything on GitHub is **open access**! If part of your content is confidential, please write e.g., '… contact [name, e-mail address] for password…' etc..

## First login

2. Sign up for a GitHub account
3. Send your username to Administrator Luke Johnston (lwjohnst@clin.au.dk) and be added as a team member
4. You'll receive an invitation mail. Join @steno-aarhus through the link (the link expires in 7 days)
