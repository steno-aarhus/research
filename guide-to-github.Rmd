# Guide to GitHub

In SDCA Research we use GitHub for common docs and support.  This is a quick guide to write your first (or second) content and contribute to the community. 
Please be aware that everything on GitHub is **open access**! If part of your content is confidential, please write e.g., '… contact [name, e-mail address] for password…' etc..

## First login

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/steno-aarhus/research/)
2. Sign up for a GitHub account
