title: "About"

We are a group of researchers working within the Steno Diabetes Center
Aarhus. Our research spans multiple fields, all of which are tied by the
study of diabetes.

## Purpose

There are a few purposes for this website:

1.  We want this to be an "entry point" for newcomers to SDCA to use in
    getting started, to learning the culture at SDCA, how to do common
    tasks, and generally getting help overall.
2.  This is a way for us to explicitly describe the research culture so
    we can more easily collaborate with, get help from, and generally
    support each other.
3.  To begin documenting how to do things so others can learn and
    benefit from our experiences, and so that we can make use of others'
    experiences and knowledge.
