Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus covers a wide range of research areas. A
listing of all the research areas is listed in the main [SDCA
Research](https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/research) website. A
patient-centered approach is achieved by research activities relevant to
prevention and treatment of diabetes, or contribution to the
understanding of the disease in humans. We build upon a well-established
research environment and long-standing collaborations between Aarhus
University, Aarhus University Hospital and other hospitals in the
Central Region of Denmark.
