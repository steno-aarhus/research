Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus covers a wide range of research areas. A
patient-centered approach is achieved by research activities relevant to
prevention and treatment of diabetes, or contribution to the
understanding of the disease in humans.

We build upon a well-established research environment and long-standing
collaborations between Aarhus University, Aarhus University Hospital and
other hospitals in the Central Region of Denmark.
