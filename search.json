    "text": "Types of meetings\nWhen setting up a meeting, it helps to have an idea on what type of meeting you want it to be and what the goals of the meeting are. Here are a few types to get you thinking about it.\n\nOnboarding meetings: Can be used for when a project starts up or when new people join a project or organization. They can give clarity on the overall structure, what the project is about (or what projects are on-going within an organization), what the newcomer(s) role is and how they fit into the broader picture, as well as to clarify expectations on tasks and duties. Much of this information should also be provided in a text based format.\nBrainstorming meetings: This is the best reason to have a meeting, when you want to brainstorm ideas. Brainstorming works best when you are together (in person or virtual), where you can come up with ideas, have others immediate input, and to build off of or improve on those ideas.\nFeedback and retrospective meetings evaluate the process: what went well, what didn‚Äôt, how to proceed and what will be changed for the next project."

Consider using another platform than meeting to share this information, e.g., Slack, Trello, etc\nProblem-solving: The goal is to crowdsource advice and build a plan based on that knowledge, such as by discussing ways to optimize an experimental set-up.\nDiscussion: The purpose is to exchange perspectives on a topic, such as by discussing the implications of a recently published paper."

Have people write down their questions during the meeting. Collect them and go over them as a group. This can help introverts, or those who don‚Äôt feel comfortable speaking up, get their concerns addressed. Break people into groups and have them accomplish small tasks, or make decisions, together. Then have them share their findings with the larger group. Break the meeting into sections with a different person leading each section or part of the agenda. Switching up presenters helps refresh people‚Äôs attention span and encourages attendees to feel ownership over a topic or project.\nA facilitator should keep people on track (parking lot for off-topic ideas), summarize after each topic and assign action items (owners, due date and follow-up).\nA note taker is responsible for documenting clear and concise minutes.\nEnd the meeting if all topics are handled, even if it is ahead of schedule.\nLeave meeting with a review of clear action items, due dates, and owners."

Their guides are all available in either English or Danish.\n\nWiFi: Accessing internet is done with eduroam. Set up is done through their guide.\nVPN: When working remotely, many university and research services are only available by connecting to the university VPN. Use their Setup Guide.\nPersonal drive: You can connect and access your personal drive from your computer by following these instructions.\nShared drive(s): If you need access to a shared drive that your team or colleagues use, start with first requesting access to it. Once you get it, follow these steps to access it on your computer.\nEmail and calendar: Setting up or accessing your email and calender is done by going through their Email FAQ Guide.\n\n\n\nUnlike Aarhus University, which is quite familiar and used to a diverse set of IT needs and international employees, the Region doesn‚Äôt have as well developed and clear documentation for IT related topics. Documentation is also entirely in Danish. Help, support, and most other documents or services are almost completely only available through the ‚ÄúCitrixportal‚Äù, which you need to log into with your Region ID. Details about how to gain access is found either here (if outside the Region intranet, you will need to follow this guide to activate two-factor authentication codes).\n\nPersonal drives: Accessed by searching for ‚ÄúStifinder‚Äù in the Citrix portal. Files saved to the Region personal drive are difficult to access outside of the Citrixportal and can‚Äôt easily be shared with others who do not have a Region ID. So we do not recommend using the Region drives for anything but highly sensitive information. Data should not be saved on the personal drive, but instead should be saved through appropriate sources (depends on your research team).\nShared drives: Accessed by searching for ‚ÄúStifinder Afdeling‚Äù in the Citrixportal. Like with the personal drive above, unless you need to save and share information that is highly sensitive, we recommend not to use the shared drive and instead use other sources (like GitHub or the Aarhus University shared drives).\nEmail and calendar: You can open your email and calendar either through the Citrixportal or by using post.rm.dk.\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of which institution is your administrative employer, if you work primarily at SDCA, there are a number of helpful template files and other resources found only in Citrix (by searching for ‚ÄúStifinder Afdeling‚Äù). We hope to slowly make these files more easily available, but until then, you can find relevant ones by asking your colleagues."
