    "text": "Needs\nIncreasingly, researchers around the world are using Git to work collaboratively together and using GitHub to share those Git projects. For articles discussing GitHub and research, see here, here, here, here, here, and here to name a few. Tools like RStudio for R or Jupyter for Python have built-in support for Git and excellent integration with GitHub. Many courses for PhD students also include GitHub, or reference GitHub in some way, so increasingly, they are being exposed to and using GitHub in their own work. For example, in the Reproducible Research in R workshops taught with the Danish Endocrinology and Diabetes Academy.\nAs researchers at Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, we need a platform where we can share procedures, guidelines, host project websites, and put documents that we collaborate on. Preferably, we want a tool that researchers are already using or will likely use in the near future, and we want a tool that integrates easily into how we already work. We would rather not have to teach and learn a tool that is only used in one area (e.g. only to host websites or keep documents), but rather use a tool that is increasingly part of a researcher’s current or future toolbox.\nWe also want a tool that is relatively easy to contribute to, even for those outside of Steno Aarhus (e.g. external collaborators). We want as little friction as possible between a person wanting to add, change, or create something on a website and it going online in as little time as possible. That means, the person wanting to contribute should not need to coordinate with someone else, wait for someone else to do it, or that it takes a long time for a change to be approved and put online. We want to empower researchers.\nBecause of this, GitHub is the best and optimal tool to use. We already currently use GitHub at Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus for a wide variety of purposes, ranging from working on research projects like the UK Biobank, developing tools like the Open Source Diabetes Classifier, to hosting websites for projects like ON-LiMiT, to listing all Steno Aarhus GitHub webpages at the main website."

    "text": "So what is Git and GitHub?\nThis could be a full document on its own. But to keep it short, Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your files and store them in a “history of changes” called a repository. It is a powerful tool to use when working alone, but especially when working with others. It allows you to work on the same files together, and keep track of who made which changes when. It is a tool used by millions of people around the world, especially in the software development community. Software like RStudio and Jupyter or services like Netflix or Airbnb are all developed with Git, while companies like Microsoft or Apple or governments like the UK government use Git to develop their software. You can, however, use Git for more than just software; you use it to track changes to any type of file on your computer.\nGitHub is a web-based platform for hosting/storing Git repositories. It adds extra features on top of Git’s file history tracking, like issue and task tracking, pull requests for collaboration, project management, and the ability to host files for a website. GitHub is the most popular Git hosting platform, is owned by Microsoft, and is used by millions of people around the world every day. It hosts software and documentation used in all areas of life, from healthcare to finance to security to the functioning of the internet itself."

Aside from this, it is:\n\nFree to use for both private repositories (with limited features) and public ones (with nearly all features).\nIncredibly reliable and stable, primarily because it is depended on by so many people and organizations which places high pressure on GitHub to be reliable and stable.\nIt is very secure and has dedicated teams working to protect it from attacks. Individual Git repositories can be secured even further with multiple other settings.\nIt has a very user friendly interface, including with many accessibility features such as for colour-blindness.\nMany researchers, especially new researchers, are already using Git and GitHub. Or they will very likely be using it in the near future because of the increasing popularity of Git and GitHub in the research community.\nGit and GitHub are tools that empower participation and collaboration, because of the way it is designed. Anyone can contribute to a public repository through features called pull requests, which means that if someone sees a typo or mistake in a webpage or in analysis code, they can easily and directly make a fix and suggest it to be added."

    "section": "Security",
    "text": "Security\nSecurity is a major concern for most organizations, especially nowadays. This concern is not just for academic institutions, but also for companies and governments. Since so many organizations around the world depend on GitHub, security is a big priority for them. Because so many people depend on it, GitHub experiences regular and repeated attacks. Even still, it almost never goes down, and when it does, it is usually for an hour or two. That’s because of the dedicated teams of people at GitHub working to defend against these attacks, e.g. see some discussion of security practices here or here. While they do internal security work, they also have extensive documentation to guide their users on what the user can do to improve security of their repositories.\nAnd, if something does happen to GitHub, because of the way Git works it is very easy to move your content to another Git hosting platform.\nSome security practices we use for the Steno Aarhus GitHub organization:\n\nWe follow the principle of least privilege. By default, all members can only read other repositories unless they are assigned to a team that has write access to a repository or are added directly to a repository.\nAll main “branches” in our repositories are protected and can’t be deleted by anyone aside from the organization owners (in case of an emergency). Only a few people are given owner status in the organization.\n\nHaving said that, no system is truly secure. No organisation or service can protect against social engineering attacks like phishing or other attacks that target the user. Users are generally the weakest link in the security chain. We can’t control that aside from limiting access and educate users. This requires educating and training users on basic security practices."

    "title": "GitHub",
    "section": "Hosting websites",
    "text": "Hosting websites\nOne of the biggest reasons we at Steno Aarhus use GitHub is to host websites. GitHub has a service called GitHub Pages that allows you to host a website for free.\nWhat does “host” and “website” mean? Websites are simply a collection of plain HTML files that are linked together and that have styling instructions from files called CSS files. If you open these files in a browser like Firefox or Chrome, they will be displayed as a regular website. But if you open those same files in a text editor, you will see HTML code and text. That’s because browsers take the HTML text and visually render it into the nice form we see on websites.\nTo host a website means to put those HTML and CSS files on a server in a way that a browser anywhere in the world can read if given the correct URL address. That’s it. Hosting is simply copying the files to the server that connects to the internet.\nIn the case of GitHub Pages, you are giving GitHub a set of static (not interactive or dynamic) HTML files that GitHub will put online (host) for you. It does not do anything else for you. How you generate the HTML files is up to you. We use a tool called Quarto to generate the HTML files from the more human-friendly Markdown files to make the Steno Aarhus websites. Read about our reasons for using Quarto on our Quarto page.\nThe advantage of using GitHub Pages for this is that because the HTML files are simply copied static files, our websites are quick to load and won’t go down unless GitHub itself goes down. Because they are static files that aren’t connected to any database or backend, there is no way to access or exploit anything, making them secure by default. Even if a contributor makes a mistake in writing the Markdown files and the Quarto tool can’t regenerate the updated website, the existing website stays online. It only gets updated when a completed re-generation of the HTML files happens. If it isn’t completed, nothing changes on the website.\nAll this makes GitHub Pages a very reliable, secure, fast, and easy way to host websites."

    "text": "Potential consequences\nEvery decision always has some consequences. For us, the biggest one is the time commitment needed to learn how to use Git and GitHub. Although it isn’t too complicated to learn the basics, it is still a complex tool with a lot of functionality. That means it can take time to become familiar and comfortable with it.\nThe advantage of GitHub compared to a dedicated website hosting service is that, if a researcher learns Git and GitHub, they can easily incorporate that knowledge into their own workflow and research. If they learn a website-specific tool, that knowledge and skill will only apply to that tool and not translate to improving their research workflow. So learning Git and GitHub in this case is an investment that has multiple sources of return, such as improving collaboration, improving reproducibility and transparency, and simplifying the process of sharing their work with others.\nPlus, many groups across Steno Aarhus are already using GitHub (e.g. the epidemiology group) and we have workshops and documentation to train people on using Git and GitHub. Which means there is support and help that is available."

While you can use Citrix and the software provided there, getting a so-called advanced setup and installing applications locally is most likely a much better choice. The following sections describe a) how to set up a Windows laptop for local use, b) general tips for using Citrix and the IT infrastructure.\n“Citrix” is a cloud-based workspace app to access all Region Midt’s IT solutions. You can find IT support and guides on the Regions intranet. Help, support, documents or other services are also almost only available through Citrix.\nTo access Citrix you need to have a Region ID and log in with your MitID or scan your access card. If you need help with this, please ask Julie Knudsen julie.knudsen@rm.dk.\nIf you are using a Region Midt computer, all programs need to be opened through the Citrix app. If you are working from another computer, you can get access through https://citrix.rm.dk/.\nPrinting\nTo use the Regional cloud printers, follow the guide on Serviceportal. Summary for English speakers:\n\nClick the ‘Start’ button in Windows and go to ‘Enheder og printere’ (EN: Devices and printers).\nClick the ‘Tilføj en printer’ (EN: “Add a printer”) button in the top panel\nChoose ‘Den printer, jeg søger efter, findes ikke på listen’ (EN: “The printer that I want isn’t listed”) and click ‘Næste’.\nChoose ‘Søg efter en printer i kataloget, baseret på placering eller funktion’ and click ‘Næste’ (EN: “Find a printer in the directory, based on location or feature”) and click ‘Næste’.\nThe names of printers at Aarhus University Hospital are prefixed 1_, so enter 1_ in the ‘Navn’ (EN: Name) field and press Enter to find these. Double-click the printer to install it (e.g. for A4-size prints, add 1_RM_A4_Farve for colour and 1_RM_A4_SH for black and white prints). Click ‘Næste’ and ‘Udført’ to complete the setup.\nNow you can send documents to the printers. The document will be physically printed when you log on to one of the Minolta printers around the hospital. At Steno, the Minolta printer is located on the 3rd floor around one of the corners of the office corridor where various office items are also stored. Log on using your Region ID and password or keycard.\n\nHow to set up your Windows laptop for local use\nFirst, you need to do some shopping on the Regional Serviceportal - either using the direct links provided in this guide or by clicking the “Jeg mangler noget”-shopping cart icon on the landing page.\nPlease note that purchases on the Serviceportal will require approval from your supervisor or manager and an EAN number for payments, so make sure to have that sorted out beforehand. In some cases, the software needs to first be approved for your user, and only then can it be remotely installed on your machine by Serviceportal admins. You may be able to shorten this delay by filing a support ticket to remind the admins to install your applications after the first approval.\n\nRequest an advanced personal (“avanceret personlig”) work laptop and order it in the Serviceportal\n\nThis will install the Access Director software, which enables you to get administrator privileges to install software locally for 5 minutes at a time.\nNote: The IT department cannot provide support for advanced personal setups.\n\nSearch the Serviceportal for any software you might need and request a local installation and access to these (e.g. MS Office, MS Teams, Adobe Acrobat etc.).\n\nYou can also search for and request a VPN installation via the Serviceportal.\n\nYou will need to change your browser’s download folder from the default (OneDrive) to a folder located on your local disk (create one, e.g. C:/local_downloads) in order to comfortably download and install programs as you normally wood. Next, you need run Access Director before installing other necessary software locally (e.g. R, RStudio, Git, Python, Conda, etc.). Read the Serviceportals guide to Access Director for details. Furthermore, some installation files will be blocked, such as .msi-installers, and you will need to Shift right-click and choose “install as other user” as described in the Access Director guide to .msi-files. If you still encounter problems with some installers being blocked, see if these can be installed through the Microsoft Store instead.\nVPN can be ordered through the Serviceportal for working remotely (requires phone for two-factor authentication).\nLinux applications can be run via Windows Subsystems for Linux (WSL1 or WSL2), which can be installed via Powershell as described in the WSL installation guide (after running Access Director). Note that WSL2 will not use the Windows VPN by default (as opposed to WSL1, so setting up a WSL1 environment may provide a fix if you need Linux apps to use the VPN).\nTo book rooms for meetings, you can simply use Pronestor in the browser, rather than the Citrix link.\n\nWith this local setup, you can completely avoid using Citrix and get a much more stable, fast and flexible workstation, similar to those provided to AU employees. Therefore, the next section is less relevant for users using the above local setup.\nGeneral tips for Citrix and the regional IT infrastructure\nHelp, support, and most other documents or services are almost completely only available through the “Citrix” webportal, which you need to log into with your Region ID. Details about how to gain access is found either here (if outside the Region intranet, you will need to follow this guide to activate two-factor authentication codes).\n\nPersonal drives: Accessed by searching for “Stifinder” in Citrix. Files saved to the Region personal drive are difficult to access outside of Citrix and can’t easily be shared with others who do not have a Region ID. So we do not recommend using the Region drives unless it is highly sensitive information. Data should instead be saved on shared drives or through other appropriate sources (depends on your research team).\nShared drives: Accessed by searching for “Stifinder Afdeling” in Citrix. Like with the personal drive above, it depends on what kind of information you need to save and share, whether you should use the shared drive or instead use other sources. Like with the personal drive above, unless you need to save and share information that is highly sensitive, we recommend not to use the shared drive and instead use other sources (like GitHub or the Aarhus University shared drives).\nEmail and calendar: You can open your email and calendar either through Citrix or by using post.rm.dk.\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of which institution is your administrative employer, if you work primarily at SDCA, there are a number of helpful template files and other resources found only in Citrix (by searching for “Stifinder Afdeling”). We hope to slowly make these files more easily available, but until then, you can find relevant ones by asking your colleagues."

You need to create a folder first (type the name then type /) and then you can create the file, which should always be called index.md. The reason for this name is because this name is used specifically for making websites.\nAdd Markdown formatted text to the file. Review the Writing Markdown guide for learning what Markdown is. Every Markdown file should always have this YAML header pasted at the top, that you should fill out with details inside the quotes:\n---\ntitle: \"\"\ndescription: \"\"\ndate: \"\"\nauthor:\n  - name: \"\"\n    affiliations:\n      - name: \"\"\n---\nOnce you are done adding content or need to finish for the day, click the green “Commit” changes button on the top right and write a short, brief commit message about what you changed and why (can be optional).

The below video covers both, as well as the text below.\n\n\nModifying by using the GitHub approach\nHere is a written description of the workflow to adding text in the files:\n\nLike with the first item in the “Adding new content” above, create a new branch by clicking the button that says “Main” and type out the (new or existing) name of your new branch by using either your own name (without spaces, or using - instead) or, what I recommend, a brief description of what you plan to add (e.g. editing-conference-travel for adding content about traveling to conferences).\n\nIf the branch doesn’t exist, after you type out the branch name, click the text that says “Create branch …”. It will now switch over to that new branch.\nIf you have already created a branch for the content and are coming back to continue your work, then when you type out the branch name (or scroll through the list), you can select the branch to switch over to it.\n\nClick the appropriate folder and file that has the content you want to edit. After clicking the file, click the pencil icon in the top right corner to enter the GitHub editor.\nWhile in the editor, you can modify the content. The text is Markdown, which has special syntax. Review the Writing Markdown guide for learning what Markdown is.\nOnce you are done adding content or need to finish for the day, click the green “Commit” changes button on the top right and write a short, brief commit message about what you changed and why (can be optional). Then, making sure you have your branch selected, click the Commit button.\n\nCommit your changes often.

On the website there are these links, either on the left sidebar or at the very bottom of the page, that say “Edit this page”. After clicking it, it will take you to the GitHub Editor as described above. The only difference with this approach is that when you click “Commit”, it will automatically select the “Create new branch” option and, after committing, will open a Pull Request for you."

    "text": "In order to ensure that we get the most from creating these documents and that we don’t spend more time on this than is necessary (given it is largely a secondary task and activity to our collective research responsibilities), here are some principles to guide our decisions and activity on what documents get created:\n\nAll are welcome to contribute: There should be no or little barrier to contributing to the documents and their content, aside from barriers due to technology and skill in its use. If someone has the motivation and desire to contribute, they should be able to do so fairly easily.\nInclusion and participation in community through active contribution: Individuals who want to participate should actively contribute through not just attending meetings, but also in creating, modifying, organizing, editing, and/or developing the content on the website. Those who actively contribute should be included in the community and encouraged to participate.\nContent is dictated by direct and active contribution: What gets created or developed should be done by whoever contributes to creating or building it. If someone wants or requests something to be created or modified, they are encouraged and given the power to do so themselves. In combination with the first principle, the barrier to contributing is only dependent on learning the basic technical and writing skills rather than any administrative barrier such as “requiring permission”. If you want something, than you are free to make it! We create and add content to the website based on what we personally want or are motivated to do, rather than what we are told to do1.\nImportant or significant decisions are based on community consensus: Decisions should not or need not be blocked by requiring permission from anything external to the community. This ensures things move forward as continuously and unrestricted as possible. Important or significant decisions could include things like approving and finalizing a document or deciding on major infrastructural changes (e.g. platform to use for creating and managing the content).\n\n\n\n1 …though we recognize that sometimes we must do things we are told to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis website and the documents contained within are aimed at researchers, PhD students, staff, and external collaborators."

After you edit the files in the “copy” (branch), you can request your changes get included into the main branch.\n\n\nCreating a new personal branch.\n\n\n\nIf you want to add a new file, rather than modify and existing one, go to “Create new file”:\n\n\n\n\nAdding a new file to your personal branch.\n\n\n\nGive your file a name, for instance guide-to-github.md (only small characters and use - for spaces).

They can give clarity on the overall structure, what the project is about (or what projects are on-going within an organization), what the newcomer(s) role is and how they fit into the broader picture, as well as to clarify expectations on tasks and duties. Much of this information should also be provided in a text based format.\nBrainstorming meetings: This is the best reason to have a meeting, when you want to brainstorm ideas. Brainstorming works best when you are together (in person or virtual), where you can come up with ideas, have others immediate input, and to build off of or improve on those ideas.\nFeedback and retrospective meetings evaluate the process: what went well, what didn’t, how to proceed and what will be changed for the next project."

But not everyone has Outlook or don’t want to use multiple calendars, like if they are employed at Aarhus University but with an affiliation with the Region.\nThe next way of booking rooms is through the Citrix, which you can only access if you have MitID. After you log into Citrix, use the Search button on the top right corner to look for Pronestor.\nWhen it shows itself on the screen, click the icon for Pronestor. After it opens up, you should see a list of dates. Select the date you want to book by clicking the button “Ny mødebestilling”. You’ll be given a list of rooms to book. Select the start time (“start”) and end time (“slut”) at the top, then click the room that is available. Afterwards, continue by clicking the “Check ud” at the top.\nThat’s it, you’ve booked the room!\nThere are also several “frirum” (free rooms), which are small meeting rooms that cannot be booked and are available if they are empty. There is usually one available at all times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis website and the documents contained within are aimed at researchers, PhD students, staff, and external collaborators."

Licensors should read and understand the terms\n and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\n material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\n licensed material, or material used under an exception or\n limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:\nwiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license.

Use of\n the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n respect those requests where reasonable.

In this case, the repository is the website with the Issues, files, and subfolders for this project.\nIssue: An Issue is a task or to-do item that needs to be completed. These to-do items can be assigned to people and can be checked off as being done (“Closed”).\nBranch: A branch is a separate, parallel set of files and folders related to the project. In this project there is the “main” branch that only the admin can edit. In order to add content to the main branch, you need to create your own branch and create a pull request of your changes and additions that you want added to the main files. Branches and pull requests are heavily used in the “GitHub workflow” that this project (and many many others) use. More details about this are in the next section and video. Branches are in some ways like separate files that you would email between other contributors, but instead of everyone having different versions of the file, here they are all contained in the same place (in the repository).\nPull request: A pull request is a request to add changes you’ve made to files in your branch and have them put into the main branch. When you make a pull request, it allows others to review what you’ve changed and make comments on it. Think of it like “Track changes” and the “Add comment” features of Word.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis website and the documents contained within are aimed at researchers, PhD students, staff, and external collaborators."

It is widely used for writing documentation, and other types of content. Markdown is easy to read and write, and it can be converted to HTML (for websites) and other formats (like PDFs).\nSince we’re using Quarto, the files you write your website content in will be in either the .qmd (the q in qmd stands for Quarto Markdown) or .md format (which stands for “Markdown”). These file formats mean you can write your content using Markdown. To learn how to write in Markdown, check out our guide or the Quarto documentation."

    "text": "Multi-page websites\nIf you want multiple pages on your GitHub website, you can add them in the navigation bar at the top of the website. This will allow you to easily navigate between different pages on your website.\nTo add a page to the navigation bar, you first need to create a new .md file in your website’s GitHub repository. See Navigating GitHub for how to do this.\nThen, you can add the new page to the navigation bar. For To add it, you need to edit the _quarto.yml file in your website’s GitHub repository. This file contains the configuration settings for your Quarto project, including the navigation settings.\nIn your _quarto.yml file, you will see a section called navbar. This is where you can add your new page. You can do this by adding a new section under the navbar configuration. For example, if you want to add a page called “Om projektet” in a file named about.md, you need to add the following three lines to the navbar section of your _quarto.yml file:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nnavbar:\n  pinned: true\n  left: # add links to the left side of the navigation bar\n    - text: \"Om projektet\"  \n      href: about.md \n\nleft is the section of the navigation bar where you want to add your new page. text is the text that will be displayed in the navigation bar, and href is the link to your new page, which should include the name of the file.\nYou can also add other pages to the navigation bar in the same way. If you for example wanted to add a page called “Om os” in a file called about-us.md, you would add the following lines just below the previous lines:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\n    - text: \"Om os\"  \n      href: about-us.md \n\nWhere “Om os” is the text that will be displayed in the navigation bar, and about-us.md is name of the file with the page content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf your file is in a subfolder, you need to include the path to the file in the href section. For example, if your file is in a folder called pages, you would write href: \"pages/about.md\".\n\n\nAdding these two pages results in the following left section under navbar in your _quarto.yml file:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nnavbar: \n  pinned: true\n  left: \n    - text: \"Om projektet\"  \n      href: about.md \n    - text: \"Om os\"  \n      href: about-us.md \n\nAnd this will add two new pages with the text “Om projektet” and “Om os” to the navigation bar at the top of your website.\nSee the Quarto documentation for more information on how to set up navigation in your Quarto project."

    "text": "Needs\nCreating websites is an increasingly common need for researchers as they are expected or required to make more of an effort to communicate their research, share with others, and be more visible to others. These are some situations where researchers highly benefit from or even need a website:\n\nWhen making a software tool for a statistical method, the software will be much more likely used if there is a website that describes how to use it.\nWhen collaborating with multiple people on a specific lab method, clinical procedure, or workflow, it is much easier to write the instructions and guidelines in a website format so that it is easier for the collaborators to read and stay up to date.\nWhen making a course or workshop, it is extremely helpful to the participants to have a website that they can open and follow along.\nWhen running an event like a conference or seminar, putting the program and other relevant information on a website can make it much easier for the event participants to find the information they need.\n\nAside from the use cases above, when creating websites there are some additional needs we need to, or at least would like to, fulfill:\n\nWe need to follow the law, for instance around GDPR. While we don’t fall under the Danish web accessibility law as the website is not targeted to the general public, we still aim to ensure that more people are able to read or navigate the website in an accessible way.\nWe want the tool we use to create websites to be a tool that is commonly used by researchers in their own work, so they don’t have to learn a whole other tool just to create a website.\nThe tool should be fairly easy to use."

    "section": "How Quarto fits our needs",
    "text": "How Quarto fits our needs\nQuarto is a tool that is very commonly used by researchers using R and RStudio, but also increasingly by researchers using Python. Because it integrates very well with doing data analysis and creating reproducible reports, many researchers including at Steno Aarhus are already using it. So using Quarto to create a website is a more gentle learning experience than using a completely different tool.\nQuarto uses a widely used website theme generator called Bootstrap and includes fully-developed themes from Bootswatch. This means that it is easy to create an engaging and fully functional website that is easy to navigate and use, thus already fulfilling many of the requirements for accessibility.\nSince Quarto is a static HTML website generator, it doesn’t include any dynamic content that would require a database, or running code in the browser with JavaScript, or other server-side processing. That means that from the start, it is secure, fast, reliable, and doesn’t (can’t) collect any data. As a result, the researcher doesn’t have to worry about GDPR or other data privacy issues.\nQuarto uses Markdown, which is a simple and easy-to-learn markup language that is widely used by researchers. This means that researchers can easily create and edit the content of the website. Markdown is widely used on the internet for things like forums, blogs, or social media posts. And because Quarto uses Markdown, which is a plain text format, it is easy to use with GitHub making it easy to build automated scripts to run checks on the files.\nQuarto includes many built-in accessibility features, such as adding alternative text to images, ARIA labels, and semantic HTML. Since it generates static HTML files with no dynamic elements, it is much easier for screen readers and other assistive technologies to read and navigate the website."

    "text": "Accessibility\nAccessibility is an important topic for us. But it’s also an incredibly complicated area, and it’s difficult or near-impossible to address all possible accessibility aspects.\nLike all website tools or services, Quarto on its own can’t incorporate all aspects of accessibility. Many things require manual editing. Things we at Steno Aarhus do to help improve accessibility are:\n\nWe use a custom theme that is designed to be as compliant as possible with the web accessibility guidelines as well as with GDPR rules (e.g. not loading resources from services that do collect personal data, such as Google). This theme is available at the steno-aarhus/sdca-theme.\nWe have guides that explain how to write Markdown files in a way that is as accessible as possible. The main things website authors need to include are alternative text for images, turning on closed caption for videos (which is easy for e.g. YouTube videos), and writing Markdown in a consistent and structured way.\nLink rot is a problem that affects all websites, but especially those that are not maintained. This is something that is difficult to avoid even using the “best” software and services. Because Markdown files are plain text, we can easily create an automated script to do very basic checks on our repositories to check for broken links and give a warning if there are any."

It is a great choice for researchers who want to create a website for their research, as they are already likely using Quarto for their data analysis and paper writing. Since it integrates so well with GitHub as well as other tools, it makes maintaining and updating content very easy and straightforward."
