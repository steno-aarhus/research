Please be aware that everything on GitHub is open access, so don’t add anything private or confidential.\n\n\n\nSign up for a GitHub account if you don’t have one already.\nGo to the SDCA Research GitHub repository.\n\n\n\nSDCA GitHub main page.\n\n\nSend your username to administrator Luke Johnston so he can add you as a team member.\nYou’ll receive an invitation mail. Join @steno-aarhus through the link (expires in 7 days)\nWatch tutorial videos\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new (personal) branch1 to work in, since you can’t directly edit the files in the “main” branch. (You need to be added as a teammember to complete this step)\n\n1 A branch is a bit like a “copy” of the files in the “main” branch. After you edit the files in the “copy” (branch), you can request your changes get included into the main branch.\n\n\nCreating a new personal branch.\n\n\n\nIf you want to add a new file, rather than modify and existing one, go to “Create new file”:\n\n\n\n\nAdding a new file to your personal branch.\n\n\n\nGive your file a name, for instance guide-to-github.md (only small characters and use - for spaces). Use .md as the file extension, which stands for “Markdown”.\n\n\n\n\nNaming the newly created file.\n\n\n\nStart writing your content in Markdown. You can find support on how to write using Markdown in the tutorials or in GitHub’s guide on Markdown.\nIn order to save your changes you’ve made, you need to ‘commit’2 this new file to the Git history and eventually on to the website. At the bottom of the page is a text box to write a message. Please write a short message describing why you are adding the files or making the changes.\n\n2 “Commit” means to save something to the history, like you “commit” something to your memory.\n\n\nCommit the new file into the Git history.\n\n\n\nNow you can find your file in the research folder on your personal branch. You can continue writing either on this file or others by clicking the ‘Edit’ button of the file.\n\n\n\n\nFinding your newly created file in the repository.\n\n\n\n\n\nEditting the newly created file, or other files.\n\n\n\nOnce you are finished with what you want to add or modify, the next step is to get the content on the website. To do that, you’ll need to make a “pull request”3 so that your content gets merged into the main branch. Go to ‘Code’, choose your personal branch, click ‘Contribute’ and ‘Open pull request’.\n\n3 A pull request is a process of taking your branch and requesting that it get merged into the main branch. It also allows for people to comment on your changes before they get merged.\n\n\nCreating a pull request.\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve selected to make a pull request of your branch, you need to write a title describing what you are adding or changing and why. Then you can click ‘Create pull request.’. The administrator will look at the pull request and if necessary, add some edits before adding it to the main branch/webpage. Everyone can comment with suggestion for change.\n\n\n\n\nFinish with submitting the pull request.\n\n\nAnd that’s the basics!"

Their guides are all available in either English or Danish.\n\nWiFi: Accessing internet is done with eduroam. Set up is done through their guide.\nVPN: When working remotely, many university and research services are only available by connecting to the university VPN. Use their Setup Guide.\nPersonal drive: You can connect and access your personal drive from your computer by following these instructions.\nShared drive(s): If you need access to a shared drive that your team or colleagues use, start with first requesting access to it. Once you get it, follow these steps to access it on your computer.\nEmail and calendar: Setting up or accessing your email and calender is done by going through their Email FAQ Guide.\n\n\n\nUnlike Aarhus University, which is quite familiar and used to a diverse set of IT needs and international employees, the Region doesn’t have as well developed and clear documentation for IT related topics. Documentation is also entirely in Danish. Help, support, and most other documents or services are almost completely only available through the “Citrixportal”, which you need to log into with your Region ID. Details about how to gain access is found either here (if outside the Region intranet, you will need to follow this guide to activate two-factor authentication codes).\n\nPersonal drives: Accessed by searching for “Stifinder” in the Citrix portal. Files saved to the Region personal drive are difficult to access outside of the Citrixportal and can’t easily be shared with others who do not have a Region ID. So we do not recommend using the Region drives for anything but highly sensitive information. Data should not be saved on the personal drive, but instead should be saved through appropriate sources (depends on your research team).\nShared drives: Accessed by searching for “Stifinder Afdeling” in the Citrixportal. Like with the personal drive above, unless you need to save and share information that is highly sensitive, we recommend not to use the shared drive and instead use other sources (like GitHub or the Aarhus University shared drives).\nEmail and calendar: You can open your email and calendar either through the Citrixportal or by using post.rm.dk.\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of which institution is your administrative employer, if you work primarily at SDCA, there are a number of helpful template files and other resources found only in Citrix (by searching for “Stifinder Afdeling”). We hope to slowly make these files more easily available, but until then, you can find relevant ones by asking your colleagues."

We will make a difference to all people with or at risk of getting diabetes in Central Denmark Region.\nAs a new member of our research team, there is a lot of things you need learn about the organization, the culture (both research and social) and a lot of practical stuff. The page here is thought of as your initial entry point, where you can get an overview. This is also an atlas for you to return to when you need to look up specific information.\nTo get an introduction to the research team and this document you will be teamed up with an experienced member from research. It is your supervisor’s responsibility to find you a “buddy.” Please ask your supervisor if this is not already in place.\nYour buddy will walk you through the relevant tables below and give you an overview of all the topics that you need to be aware of. The agenda for the meeting is:\n\nIntroduce yourselves\nGo through the table below\nTake a tour around the research facility\nArrange follow-up talk\n\nThe purpose of the follow-up talk is to catch up on how you have settled in. If you have any specific questions you can also ask them. As the final thing, you and your buddy will evaluate the introduction. You will be given responsibility to update this website if you have encountered any information that was not up to date and you should add any other information you would have liked the page to contain. This is a very important step because it ensures that this material is always current and helps the next new team member."

    "text": "Types of meetings\nWhen setting up a meeting, it helps to have an idea on what type of meeting you want it to be and what the goals of the meeting are. Here are a few types to get you thinking about it.\n\nOnboarding meetings: Can be used for when a project starts up or when new people join a project or organization. They can give clarity on the overall structure, what the project is about (or what projects are on-going within an organization), what the newcomer(s) role is and how they fit into the broader picture, as well as to clarify expectations on tasks and duties. Much of this information should also be provided in a text based format.\nBrainstorming meetings: This is the best reason to have a meeting, when you want to brainstorm ideas. Brainstorming works best when you are together (in person or virtual), where you can come up with ideas, have others immediate input, and to build off of or improve on those ideas.\nFeedback and retrospective meetings evaluate the process: what went well, what didn’t, how to proceed and what will be changed for the next project."

Consider using another platform than meeting to share this information, e.g., Slack, Trello, etc\nProblem-solving: The goal is to crowdsource advice and build a plan based on that knowledge, such as by discussing ways to optimize an experimental set-up.\nDiscussion: The purpose is to exchange perspectives on a topic, such as by discussing the implications of a recently published paper."

Have people write down their questions during the meeting. Collect them and go over them as a group. This can help introverts, or those who don’t feel comfortable speaking up, get their concerns addressed. Break people into groups and have them accomplish small tasks, or make decisions, together. Then have them share their findings with the larger group. Break the meeting into sections with a different person leading each section or part of the agenda. Switching up presenters helps refresh people’s attention span and encourages attendees to feel ownership over a topic or project.\nA facilitator should keep people on track (parking lot for off-topic ideas), summarize after each topic and assign action items (owners, due date and follow-up).\nA note taker is responsible for documenting clear and concise minutes.\nEnd the meeting if all topics are handled, even if it is ahead of schedule.\nLeave meeting with a review of clear action items, due dates, and owners."
