Permanent Ban\n\nAttribution\n\nOur Pledge\nWe as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.\nWe pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.\nOur Standards\nExamples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:\nDemonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people\nBeing respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences\nGiving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback\nAccepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience\nFocusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community\nExamples of unacceptable behavior include:\nThe use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind\nTrolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks\nPublic or private harassment\nPublishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission\nOther conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting\nEnforcement Responsibilities\nCommunity leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\nCommunity leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.\nScope\nThis Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.\nEnforcement\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at TODO: [INSERT CONTACT METHOD]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.\nAll community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.\nEnforcement Guidelines\nCommunity leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:\n1. Correction\nCommunity Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\nConsequence: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.\n2. Warning\nCommunity Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.\nConsequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.\n3. Temporary Ban\nCommunity Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.\nConsequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.\n4. Permanent Ban\nCommunity Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.\nConsequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.\nAttribution\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.0, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/ code_of_conduct.html.\nCommunity Impact Guidelines were inspired by Mozilla’s code of conduct enforcement ladder.\nFor answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see the FAQ at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq.

The content on this repository and website are licensed under the CC-BY 4.0 License, and by contributing content any contributors agree to these terms. We also have a Code of Conduct that contributors agree to abide by.\nGuiding principles\nIn order to ensure that we get the most from creating these documents and that we don’t spend more time on this than is necessary (given it is largely a secondary task and activity to our collective research responsibilities), here are some principles to guide our decisions and activity on what documents get created:\nAll are welcome to contribute: There should be no or little barrier to contributing to the documents and their content, aside from barriers due to technology and skill in its use. If someone has the motivation and desire to contribute, they should be able to do so fairly easily.\nInclusion and participation in community through active contribution: Individuals who want to participate should actively contribute through not just attending meetings, but also in creating, modifying, organizing, editing, and/or developing the content on the website. Those who actively contribute should be included in the community and encouraged to participate.\nContent is dictated by direct and active contribution: What gets created or developed should be done by whoever contributes to creating or building it. If someone wants or requests something to be created or modified, they are encouraged and given the power to do so themselves. In combination with the first principle, the barrier to contributing is only dependent on learning the basic technical and writing skills rather than any administrative barrier such as “requiring permission”. If you want something, than you are free to make it! We create and add content to the website based on what we personally want or are motivated to do, rather than what we are told to do1.\nImportant or significant decisions are based on community consensus: Decisions should not or need not be blocked by requiring permission from anything external to the community. This ensures things move forward as continuously and unrestricted as possible. Important or significant decisions could include things like approving and finalizing a document or deciding on major infrastructural changes (e.g. platform to use for creating and managing the content).\nGovernance\nNavigating the GitHub project\nThe below video is a quick tutorial on how to navigate this project on GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are some terms used in the video:\nRepository: A repository is everything that is contained within the project. In this case, the repository is the website with the [Issues], files, and subfolders for this project.\nIssue: An Issue is a task or to-do item that needs to be completed. These to-do items can be assigned to people and can be checked off as being done (“Closed”).\nBranch: A branch is a separate, parallel set of files and folders related to the project. In this project there is the “main” branch that only the admin can edit. In order to add content to the main branch, you need to create your own branch and create a pull request of your changes and additions that you want added to the main files. Branches and pull requests are heavily used in the “GitHub workflow” that this project (and many many others) use. More details about this are in the next section and video. Branches are in some ways like separate files that you would email between other contributors, but instead of everyone having different versions of the file, here they are all contained in the same place (in the repository).\nPull request: A pull request is a request to add changes you’ve made to files in your branch and have them put into the main branch. When you make a pull request, it allows others to review what you’ve changed and make comments on it. Think of it like “Track changes” and the “Add comment” features of Word.\nAdding new or modifying content as a team member\nThe video below is a tutorial on how to add or modify content and files on the GitHub project. For this to work, you need to be added as a team member and have a GitHub Account. Make sure to send the admin (Luke Johnston) your GitHub username so he can add you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent is formatted using Markdown (in this case, R Markdown) and you can learn how to write in Markdown on the GitHub Markdown Guide. There are also some terms used in the video:\nCommit: A commit is the set of changes you’ve made to a file that will be put into the history. In general, committing changes to the history is better done often.\nChanges/commit History: The commit history is all the changes, either additions or deletions, that have been done to the files in the project.\nHere is a written description of the workflow to adding or modifying text in the files:\nCreate or switch to your own branch.\nEither use the “Add a file” button or choose a file and click the “Edit this file” button.\nAdd Markdown formatted text to the file.\nScroll to the bottom to the “Commit” changes section and write a short, brief commit message about what you changed and why (can be optional). Then, making sure you have your branch selected, click the Commit button.\nCommit your changes often. Don’t be shy about making many commits to the files you are changing.\n\nWhen you are happy with your changes and want them to be added to the main branch (so they can be put on the website), click the “pull request” button, write a short message as a title on what you are changing or adding in the pull request, and click “Create pull request”. Now your changes can be reviewed!\nThe basics of writing in Markdown\nThe video below is a tutorial on the basics of using Markdown to write the content of this website. When you write content for any documents on this repository, the content needs to be written in Markdown. So take some time to watch the video and learn a bit about Markdown. I promise, it won’t take long to learn!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more guides and references on writing in Markdown, see GitHub’s Guide Mastering Markdown or, for a more reference and list style of documentation, GitHub’s Writing on GitHub documentation. To see a “real-world” example, check out how the Code of Conduct is written.\n\n\n\n\n\n…though we recognize that sometimes we must do things we are told to do.↩︎\n",
