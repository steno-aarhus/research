Please ask your supervisor about it if you have further questions.\n\nOnboarding\nEither your supervisor or your ‚Äúbuddy‚Äù will walk you through the relevant onboarding pages and give you an overview of the topics that you need to be aware of.\nWe suggest that you use this agenda for the onboarding:\n\nIntroduce yourselves\nGo through the onboarding pages and give an overview of where to find other relevant information\nTake a tour around the research facility\nArrange a follow-up talk\n\nThe purpose of the follow-up talk is to catch up on how you have settled in. If you have any specific questions you can also ask them. As the final thing, we encourage you to evaluate the introduction.\n\n\nHelp us keep the information up to date\nIt is your responsibility to update this website if you have encountered any information that was not up to date and you should add any other information you would have liked the page to contain.

    "text": "Institute-specific details\n\nAarhus UniversityRegion Midt\n\n\nSpecific support can be found on the Guides website or by contacting Aarhus University directly on their contacts page. Their guides are all available in either English or Danish.\n\nWiFi: Accessing internet is done with eduroam. Set up is done through their guide.\nVPN: When working remotely, many university and research services are only available by connecting to the university VPN. Use their Setup Guide.\nPersonal drive: You can connect and access your personal drive from your computer by following these instructions.\nShared drive(s): If you need access to a shared drive that your team or colleagues use, start with first requesting access to it. Once you get it, follow these steps to access it on your computer.\nEmail and calendar: Setting up or accessing your email and calender is done by going through their Email FAQ Guide.\n\n\n\nUnlike Aarhus University, which is quite familiar and used to a diverse set of IT needs and international employees, the Region doesn‚Äôt have as well developed and clear documentation for IT related topics. Documentation is also entirely in Danish.\nThe infrastructure is designed around the user being connected to the regional network and working within a virtual workstation (Citrix), which can be access from any regional computer. While this basic setup is useful for clinicians that need to stay connected to their workflow as they move between physical computers during their daily work, it does not serve the needs of researchers and developers. While you can use Citrix and the software provided there, getting a so-called advanced setup and installing applications locally is most likely a much better choice. The following sections describe a) how to set up a Windows laptop for local use, b) general tips for using Citrix and the IT infrastructure.\n‚ÄúCitrix‚Äù is a cloud-based workspace app to access all Region Midt‚Äôs IT solutions. You can find IT support and guides on the Regions intranet. Help, support, documents or other services are also almost only available through Citrix.\nTo access Citrix you need to have a Region ID and log in with your MitID or scan your access card. If you need help with this, please ask Julie Knudsen julie.knudsen@rm.dk.\nIf you are using a Region Midt computer, all programs need to be opened through the Citrix app. If you are working from another computer, you can get access through https://citrix.rm.dk/.\nPrinting\nTo use the Regional cloud printers, follow the guide on Serviceportal. Summary for English speakers:\n\nClick the ‚ÄòStart‚Äô button in Windows and go to ‚ÄòEnheder og printere‚Äô (EN: Devices and printers).\nClick the ‚ÄòTilf√∏j en printer‚Äô (EN: ‚ÄúAdd a printer‚Äù) button in the top panel\nChoose ‚ÄòDen printer, jeg s√∏ger efter, findes ikke p√• listen‚Äô (EN: ‚ÄúThe printer that I want isn‚Äôt listed‚Äù) and click ‚ÄòN√¶ste‚Äô.\nChoose ‚ÄòS√∏g efter en printer i kataloget, baseret p√• placering eller funktion‚Äô and click ‚ÄòN√¶ste‚Äô (EN: ‚ÄúFind a printer in the directory, based on location or feature‚Äù) and click ‚ÄòN√¶ste‚Äô.\nThe names of printers at Aarhus University Hospital are prefixed 1_, so enter 1_ in the ‚ÄòNavn‚Äô (EN: Name) field and press Enter to find these. Double-click the printer to install it (e.g.¬†for A4-size prints, add 1_RM_A4_Farve for colour and 1_RM_A4_SH for black and white prints). Click ‚ÄòN√¶ste‚Äô and ‚ÄòUdf√∏rt‚Äô to complete the setup.\nNow you can send documents to the printers. The document will be physically printed when you log on to one of the Minolta printers around the hospital. At Steno, the Minolta printer is located on the 3rd floor around one of the corners of the office corridor where various office items are also stored. Log on using your Region ID and password or keycard.\n\nHow to set up your Windows laptop for local use\nFirst, you need to do some shopping on the Regional Serviceportal - either using the direct links provided in this guide or by clicking the ‚ÄúJeg mangler noget‚Äù-shopping cart icon on the landing page.\nPlease note that purchases on the Serviceportal will require approval from your supervisor or manager and an EAN number for payments, so make sure to have that sorted out beforehand. In some cases, the software needs to first be approved for your user, and only then can it be remotely installed on your machine by Serviceportal admins. You may be able to shorten this delay by filing a support ticket to remind the admins to install your applications after the first approval.\n\nRequest an advanced personal (‚Äúavanceret personlig‚Äù) work laptop and order it in the Serviceportal\n\nThis will install the Access Director software, which enables you to get administrator privileges to install software locally for 5 minutes at a time.\nNote: The IT department cannot provide support for advanced personal setups.\n\nSearch the Serviceportal for any software you might need and request a local installation and access to these (e.g.¬†MS Office, MS Teams, Adobe Acrobat etc.).\n\nYou can also search for and request a VPN installation via the Serviceportal.\n\nYou will need to change your browser‚Äôs download folder from the default (OneDrive) to a folder located on your local disk (create one, e.g.¬†C:/local_downloads) in order to comfortably download and install programs as you normally wood. Next, you need run Access Director before installing other necessary software locally (e.g.¬†R, RStudio, Git, Python, Conda, etc.). Read the Serviceportals guide to Access Director for details. Furthermore, some installation files will be blocked, such as .msi-installers, and you will need to Shift right-click and choose ‚Äúinstall as other user‚Äù as described in the Access Director guide to .msi-files. If you still encounter problems with some installers being blocked, see if these can be installed through the Microsoft Store instead.\nVPN can be ordered through the Serviceportal for working remotely (requires phone for two-factor authentication).\nLinux applications can be run via Windows Subsystems for Linux (WSL1 or WSL2), which can be installed via Powershell as described in the WSL installation guide (after running Access Director). Note that WSL2 will not use the Windows VPN by default (as opposed to WSL1, so setting up a WSL1 environment may provide a fix if you need Linux apps to use the VPN).\nTo book rooms for meetings, you can simply use Pronestor in the browser, rather than the Citrix link.\n\nWith this local setup, you can completely avoid using Citrix and get a much more stable, fast and flexible workstation, similar to those provided to AU employees. Therefore, the next section is less relevant for users using the above local setup.\nGeneral tips for Citrix and the regional IT infrastructure\nHelp, support, and most other documents or services are almost completely only available through the ‚ÄúCitrix‚Äù webportal, which you need to log into with your Region ID. Details about how to gain access is found either here (if outside the Region intranet, you will need to follow this guide to activate two-factor authentication codes).\n\nPersonal drives: Accessed by searching for ‚ÄúStifinder‚Äù in Citrix. Files saved to the Region personal drive are difficult to access outside of Citrix and can‚Äôt easily be shared with others who do not have a Region ID. So we do not recommend using the Region drives unless it is highly sensitive information. Data should instead be saved on shared drives or through other appropriate sources (depends on your research team).\nShared drives: Accessed by searching for ‚ÄúStifinder Afdeling‚Äù in Citrix. Like with the personal drive above, it depends on what kind of information you need to save and share, whether you should use the shared drive or instead use other sources. Like with the personal drive above, unless you need to save and share information that is highly sensitive, we recommend not to use the shared drive and instead use other sources (like GitHub or the Aarhus University shared drives).\nEmail and calendar: You can open your email and calendar either through Citrix or by using post.rm.dk.\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of which institution is your administrative employer, if you work primarily at SDCA, there are a number of helpful template files and other resources found only in Citrix (by searching for ‚ÄúStifinder Afdeling‚Äù). We hope to slowly make these files more easily available, but until then, you can find relevant ones by asking your colleagues."

    "text": "In order to ensure that we get the most from creating these documents and that we don‚Äôt spend more time on this than is necessary (given it is largely a secondary task and activity to our collective research responsibilities), here are some principles to guide our decisions and activity on what documents get created:\n\nAll are welcome to contribute: There should be no or little barrier to contributing to the documents and their content, aside from barriers due to technology and skill in its use. If someone has the motivation and desire to contribute, they should be able to do so fairly easily.\nInclusion and participation in community through active contribution: Individuals who want to participate should actively contribute through not just attending meetings, but also in creating, modifying, organizing, editing, and/or developing the content on the website. Those who actively contribute should be included in the community and encouraged to participate.\nContent is dictated by direct and active contribution: What gets created or developed should be done by whoever contributes to creating or building it. If someone wants or requests something to be created or modified, they are encouraged and given the power to do so themselves. In combination with the first principle, the barrier to contributing is only dependent on learning the basic technical and writing skills rather than any administrative barrier such as ‚Äúrequiring permission‚Äù. If you want something, than you are free to make it! We create and add content to the website based on what we personally want or are motivated to do, rather than what we are told to do1.\nImportant or significant decisions are based on community consensus: Decisions should not or need not be blocked by requiring permission from anything external to the community. This ensures things move forward as continuously and unrestricted as possible. Important or significant decisions could include things like approving and finalizing a document or deciding on major infrastructural changes (e.g.¬†platform to use for creating and managing the content).\n\n\n\n1¬†‚Ä¶though we recognize that sometimes we must do things we are told to do."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The below video is a quick tutorial on how to navigate this project on GitHub.\n\nThere are some terms used in the video:\n\nRepository: A repository is everything that is contained within the project. In this case, the repository is the website with the Issues, files, and subfolders for this project.\nIssue: An Issue is a task or to-do item that needs to be completed. These to-do items can be assigned to people and can be checked off as being done (‚ÄúClosed‚Äù).\nBranch: A branch is a separate, parallel set of files and folders related to the project. In this project there is the ‚Äúmain‚Äù branch that only the admin can edit. In order to add content to the main branch, you need to create your own branch and create a pull request of your changes and additions that you want added to the main files. Branches and pull requests are heavily used in the ‚ÄúGitHub workflow‚Äù that this project (and many many others) use. More details about this are in the next section and video. Branches are in some ways like separate files that you would email between other contributors, but instead of everyone having different versions of the file, here they are all contained in the same place (in the repository).\nPull request: A pull request is a request to add changes you‚Äôve made to files in your branch and have them put into the main branch. When you make a pull request, it allows others to review what you‚Äôve changed and make comments on it. Think of it like ‚ÄúTrack changes‚Äù and the ‚ÄúAdd comment‚Äù features of Word."

It will now switch over to that new branch.\nClick the appropriate folder that the new content will be put into, either support/, onboarding/, or organization/.\nClick the ‚ÄúAdd a file‚Äù button and click the ‚ÄúCreate a new file‚Äù. Write out the name of the new folder and file at the top, using lowercase letters and either _ or - for spaces. You need to create a folder first (type the name then type /) and then you can create the file, which should always be called index.md. The reason for this name is because this name is used specifically for making websites.\nAdd Markdown formatted text to the file. Review the Writing Markdown guide for learning what Markdown is. Every Markdown file should always have this YAML header pasted at the top, that you should fill out with details inside the quotes:\n---\ntitle: \"\"\ndescription: \"\"\ndate: \"\"\nauthor:\n  - name: \"\"\n    affiliations:\n      - name: \"\"\n---\nOnce you are done adding content or need to finish for the day, click the green ‚ÄúCommit‚Äù changes button on the top right and write a short, brief commit message about what you changed and why (can be optional). Then, making sure you have your branch selected, click the Commit button.\n\nCommit your changes often. Don‚Äôt be shy about making many commits to the files you are changing.\nIf you‚Äôve committed for the day and want to come back later to continue writing, see the next section below on modifying existing content.\n\nWhen you are happy with your changes and want them to be added to the main branch (so they can be put on the website), click the ‚ÄúContributing‚Äù button, write a short message as a title on what you are changing or adding in the pull request, and click ‚ÄúCreate pull request‚Äù.

    "text": "Modifying existing content\nThere are two ways to modify existing content, either directly through GitHub or through the website. The below video covers both, as well as the text below.\n\n\nModifying by using the GitHub approach\nHere is a written description of the workflow to adding text in the files:\n\nLike with the first item in the ‚ÄúAdding new content‚Äù above, create a new branch by clicking the button that says ‚ÄúMain‚Äù and type out the (new or existing) name of your new branch by using either your own name (without spaces, or using - instead) or, what I recommend, a brief description of what you plan to add (e.g. editing-conference-travel for adding content about traveling to conferences).\n\nIf the branch doesn‚Äôt exist, after you type out the branch name, click the text that says ‚ÄúCreate branch ‚Ä¶‚Äù. It will now switch over to that new branch.\nIf you have already created a branch for the content and are coming back to continue your work, then when you type out the branch name (or scroll through the list), you can select the branch to switch over to it.\n\nClick the appropriate folder and file that has the content you want to edit. After clicking the file, click the pencil icon in the top right corner to enter the GitHub editor.\nWhile in the editor, you can modify the content. The text is Markdown, which has special syntax. Review the Writing Markdown guide for learning what Markdown is.\nOnce you are done adding content or need to finish for the day, click the green ‚ÄúCommit‚Äù changes button on the top right and write a short, brief commit message about what you changed and why (can be optional). Then, making sure you have your branch selected, click the Commit button.\n\nCommit your changes often. Don‚Äôt be shy about making many commits to the files you are changing.\nIf you‚Äôve committed for the day and want to come back later to continue writing, see the next section below on modifying existing content.\n\nWhen you are finished with your edits, you can follow the instructions above about making a Pull Request so that your changes get added to the website.\n\n\n\nModifying by going through website\nThis is the most straightforward way of editing existing content that is already on the website, for instance to fix typos or add some more clarifying words. On the website there are these links, either on the left sidebar or at the very bottom of the page, that say ‚ÄúEdit this page‚Äù. After clicking it, it will take you to the GitHub Editor as described above. The only difference with this approach is that when you click ‚ÄúCommit‚Äù, it will automatically select the ‚ÄúCreate new branch‚Äù option and, after committing, will open a Pull Request for you."

After you edit the files in the ‚Äúcopy‚Äù (branch), you can request your changes get included into the main branch.\n\n\nCreating a new personal branch.\n\n\n\nIf you want to add a new file, rather than modify and existing one, go to ‚ÄúCreate new file‚Äù:\n\n\n\n\nAdding a new file to your personal branch.\n\n\n\nGive your file a name, for instance guide-to-github.md (only small characters and use - for spaces). Use .md as the file extension, which stands for ‚ÄúMarkdown‚Äù.\n\n\n\n\nNaming the newly created file.\n\n\n\nStart writing your content in Markdown. You can find support on how to write using Markdown in this tutorial.\nIn order to save your changes you‚Äôve made, you need to ‚Äòcommit‚Äô2 this new file to the Git history and eventually on to the website. At the bottom of the page is a text box to write a message. Please write a short message describing why you are adding the files or making the changes.\n\n2¬†‚ÄúCommit‚Äù means to save something to the history, like you ‚Äúcommit‚Äù something to your memory.\n\n\nCommit the new file into the Git history.\n\n\n\nNow you can find your file in the research folder on your personal branch. You can continue writing either on this file or others by clicking the ‚ÄòEdit‚Äô button of the file.\n\n\n\n\nFinding your newly created file in the repository.\n\n\n\n\n\nEditting the newly created file, or other files.\n\n\n\nOnce you are finished with what you want to add or modify, the next step is to get the content on the website. To do that, you‚Äôll need to make a ‚Äúpull request‚Äù3 so that your content gets merged into the main branch. Go to ‚ÄòCode‚Äô, choose your personal branch, click ‚ÄòContribute‚Äô and ‚ÄòOpen pull request‚Äô.\n\n3¬†A pull request is a process of taking your branch and requesting that it get merged into the main branch. It also allows for people to comment on your changes before they get merged.\n\n\nCreating a pull request.\n\n\n\nOnce you‚Äôve selected to make a pull request of your branch, you need to write a title describing what you are adding or changing and why. Then you can click ‚ÄòCreate pull request.‚Äô. The administrator will look at the pull request and if necessary, add some edits before adding it to the main branch/webpage. Everyone can comment with suggestion for change.\n\n\n\n\nFinish with submitting the pull request.\n\n\nAnd that‚Äôs the basics!"

Here are a few types to get you thinking about it.\n\nOnboarding meetings: Can be used for when a project starts up or when new people join a project or organization. They can give clarity on the overall structure, what the project is about (or what projects are on-going within an organization), what the newcomer(s) role is and how they fit into the broader picture, as well as to clarify expectations on tasks and duties. Much of this information should also be provided in a text based format.\nBrainstorming meetings: This is the best reason to have a meeting, when you want to brainstorm ideas. Brainstorming works best when you are together (in person or virtual), where you can come up with ideas, have others immediate input, and to build off of or improve on those ideas.\nFeedback and retrospective meetings evaluate the process: what went well, what didn‚Äôt, how to proceed and what will be changed for the next project."

Consider using another platform than meeting to share this information, e.g., Slack, Trello, etc\nProblem-solving: The goal is to crowdsource advice and build a plan based on that knowledge, such as by discussing ways to optimize an experimental set-up.\nDiscussion: The purpose is to exchange perspectives on a topic, such as by discussing the implications of a recently published paper."

    "text": "At the meeting\n\nStart meetings on time even if not everybody has arrived.\nConsider banning distractions (laptops/tablets/phones) from meetings.\nConsider starting with a brief icebreaker or a quick check-in on everyone‚Äôs day or week (however, details on Trello or similar).\nConsider asking for topics to be put on AOB (any other business) at the very beginning of the meeting, so everybody has some time to prepare for a potential surprise.\nIf the meeting is part of a series, it is probably relevant to follow-up on last meeting, including progress (action items).\nPlan to engage people or check in on attendees often (examples below). Have people write down their questions during the meeting. Collect them and go over them as a group. This can help introverts, or those who don‚Äôt feel comfortable speaking up, get their concerns addressed. Break people into groups and have them accomplish small tasks, or make decisions, together. Then have them share their findings with the larger group. Break the meeting into sections with a different person leading each section or part of the agenda. Switching up presenters helps refresh people‚Äôs attention span and encourages attendees to feel ownership over a topic or project.\nA facilitator should keep people on track (parking lot for off-topic ideas), summarize after each topic and assign action items (owners, due date and follow-up).\nA note taker is responsible for documenting clear and concise minutes.\nEnd the meeting if all topics are handled, even if it is ahead of schedule.\nLeave meeting with a review of clear action items, due dates, and owners."

Many documents are at various stages of completion. üöß\n\n\nBooking rooms in Forum is fairly easy if you know how to do it. But it is not a straight forward way to find out.\nIf you have a Region email and have Outlook installed, the easiest approach to booking rooms is through the Outlook calendar. But not everyone has Outlook or don‚Äôt want to use multiple calendars, like if they are employed at Aarhus University but with an affiliation with the Region.\nThe next way of booking rooms is through the Citrix, which you can only access if you have MitID. After you log into Citrix, use the Search button on the top right corner to look for Pronestor.\nWhen it shows itself on the screen, click the icon for Pronestor. After it opens up, you should see a list of dates. Select the date you want to book by clicking the button ‚ÄúNy m√∏debestilling‚Äù. You‚Äôll be given a list of rooms to book. Select the start time (‚Äústart‚Äù) and end time (‚Äúslut‚Äù) at the top, then click the room that is available. Afterwards, continue by clicking the ‚ÄúCheck ud‚Äù at the top.\nThat‚Äôs it, you‚Äôve booked the room!\nThere are also several ‚Äúfrirum‚Äù (free rooms), which are small meeting rooms that cannot be booked and are available if they are empty. There is usually one available at all times."
