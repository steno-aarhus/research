This document is specific to SDCA employees working on Level 4 in Forum. For more onboarding information please read through the [SDCA Onboarding documents for all employees](/onboarding.md).
:::

A warm welcome to you as a new employee at Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus.
We are located in beautiful surroundings in Forum, Aarhus University
Hospital (AUH).

On Level 4 there is laboratory research, as well as office facilities,
meeting, and lunchrooms.

In this material you can find answers to a lot of questions regarding
SDCA and especially Level 4.

## Location overview

registers you in BSK and gives you access. The access card itself is
picked up in the Photo Box (Krydspunkt J110, lokale J116-106), where you
will also have your picture taken. To gain access to special locations
(e.g. Cell culture) contact Inger Hornbech
([inger.hornbech\@rm.dk](mailto:inger.hornbech@rm.dk){.email}).

## Allocation of office space

Contact Inger Hornbech
([inger.hornbech\@rm.dk](mailto:inger.hornbech@rm.dk){.email}) for
allocation of office space.

## Refrigeration and freezing space

If you are to be allocated freezer and refrigeration space, this must be
agreed with Lenette Egelund Pedersen

Our 150 degree freezer quickly raise in temperature and must be closed
quickly. Therefore, there must be control over where to find your things
and it must be noted on the writing pad when you have opened the freezer
(name, date, and time).

## Rooms for Chemical storage

We have two chemical rooms on level 4:

-   A401-118
-   A401-135

There is an LAF bench in both chemical rooms with a precise balance. In
room A401-118 there is also a pH-meter and a magnetic stirrer.<br>

You must be conscious and responsible when working with chemicals.
You are responsible for checking up on the chemicals and handling them correctly.
All chemicals must be handled according to their hazard label.
When handling chemicals with hazard label, always use gloves and work in fume hood
or LAF bench and there must be awareness about chemical waste management.
Make sure that there is a Chemical Risk Assessment in your protocol before
using any of the Hazard-labelt chemicals.

## BRIK Cabinets

There are BRIK Cabinets on level 4 in various laboratories and in the
corridors. The items in the cabinets are for everybody to use. See the
[BRIK cabinet guide](/files/brik-cabinets-availability.xlsx) for
location, instructions, and content. Inquiries regarding adding other
materials in the BRIK Cabinets: contact Henriette Kristoffersen
([henrikis\@rm.dk](mailto:henrikis@rm.dk){.email}). Other purchases are
the responsibility of the individual groups themselves.

## Waste management

In the offices there is a waste bin for paper, which is emptied by the
service staff and a bin for residual waste, which you must empty
yourself. You can place the residual waste in the waste bin in room
A401-172.

-   Cardboard boxes are folded and placed in the cage in room A401-172.
-   Glass waste is placed in cardboard box with blue garbage bag in room
    A401-172.
-   Used batteries are placed in a special container in room A401-172
-   Plastic is collected for recycling by the following sorting:
    -   *Hard plastic non-hazardous* in room lab A401-104, A401-130 and
        in cell lab A401-122+A401-123
    -   *Hard plastic non-hazardous*, is plastic that has not been in
        contact with hazardous chemicals or is infectious. For example,
        bottles for media, PBS, sterile water, pipette boxes, etc.
        However, bottles must be rinsed before being placed in the waste
        container and the lid and bottle keep apart. - *Hard plastic
        hazardous* in room A401-172.
    -   *Hard plastic hazardous* is hard plastic that has been in
        contact with hazardous chemistry, however, here there are
        exceptions. On the waste bin you can be seen which ones are
        allowed to be put in the waste container. Be aware before
        putting anything in the container.
    -   *Soft plastic non-hazardous* in Lab 401-106, Lab A401-130, as
        well as room A401-172.
    -   Soft plastic is plastic such as bubble wrap, plastic bags, etc.

See also [guide for Waste Management](/files/waste-management.pdf).

## Chemical waste

A trolley table for chemical waste is located in Room A401-172. Pick up
MUST be booked before placing the chemical waste. Instructions are
available on the trolley (in Danish). **Pay attention to waste
groups!!** Remember to write what is in the chemical waste container, as
well as approximately the amount and waste group.

## Ordering dry ice

You can pickup dry ice from A101-113, level 1 or order via the Purchasing Department (Indkøbsafdelingen), AUH -- use the
[dry ice order form (in Danish)](/files/bestilling-af-is.pdf).

## Wet-Ice

You can pick up wet-ice in room A401-128

## Autoclave

There is a small wet autoclave and two dry autoclaves in room A401-166
One dry autoclave is reserved for cell culture bottles etc. and will be
started approximately every other day. The second dry autoclave can be
used for both sterilization and for "burning" glassware for RNA/DNA
work.

## Safety and fire

There is a first aid kit in a locker in "Fællesrummet".

Spill kits for chemical accidents are available in the two Chemical
Rooms (A401-118 and A401- 135).

Fire hose can be found in "Fællesrummet".

In case of fire, the stairwells act as escape routes, the fire should be
kept out of there for min. 2 hours. All doors are fire-doors and they
close automatically upon fire. All locked doors open so you can get in
and out without access cards. Be aware that ventilation checks of fire
dampers are ongoing from 6.00-6.30 every Thursday, which means that fume
hood / LAF benches do not work during that period. Therefore, pay
attention to what is put in fume Hoods from Wednesday to Thursday.

## Workflow in laboratories

Please note that there may be different rules in the different
laboratories on level 4 and you must have a thorough instruction before
starting work. Instructions must be given on:

-   Waste management
-   Chemical Risk Assessment
-   Chemical waste
-   Glove use
-   Washing utensils
-   Safety
-   Fume Hoods
-   LAF Bench

## Use of laboratory equipment

When using/borrowing other people's equipment, permission must always be
asked and there must be thorough instruction in the use, regardless of
what is to be borrowed. The equipment will be marked with a color system
and name of an equipment responsible.

-   Green = Use without asking (e.g. Wet-ice)
-   Yellow = Ask responsible person about the possibility of borrowing
    the equipment. (e.g. EVOS)
-   Red = This equipment is not available for use

The individual research groups, at level 4, decide for themselves what
colour their own equipment should be.

## Cell Culture Lab

We have 3 Cell Culture Rooms, that are GMO Class I, two at level 4 --
room A401-122 and A401-123 and 1 Cell Culture room at J J101-120.

You must be instructed in workflow and GMO rules before you can work in
the cell labs.

Read the [GMO safety rules](/files/safety-rules-gmo-cell-lab.pdf) and
[general rules for cell labs](/files/rules-cell-labs.pdf).

If you wish to work in a cell lab, please contact: Lotte Holmbo Arentoft
([lotte.arentoft\@clin.au.dk](mailto:lotte.arentoft@clin.au.dk))
