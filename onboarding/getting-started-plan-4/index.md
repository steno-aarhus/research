A warm welcome to you as a new employee here at Steno Diabetes Center
Aarhus. We are located in beautiful surroundings in Forum, Aarhus
University Hospital (AUH).

On level 4 there is laboratory research, as well as office facilities,
meeting- and lunchrooms.

In this material you can find answers to a lot of questions regarding
SDCA and especially plan 4.

There are both descriptions and attachments.

## Refrigeration and freezing space

If you are to be allocated freezer and refrigeration space, this must be

The individual groups themselves ensure the distribution of racks in
freezers.

**NOTE:** Our 150 degree freezer quickly raise in temperature and must
be closed quickly. Therefore, there must be control of where to find
your things and it must be noted on the writing pad when you have opened
the freezer (name, date, and time).

There is a large cold room (A401-154). In it, material is placed in
plastic boxes and then on shelves assigned to the research group to
which one belongs. Contact Henriette Kristoffersen
([henrikris\@rm.dk](mailto:henrikris@rm.dk){.email}) to order the
necessary boxes.
