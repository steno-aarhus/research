Please read through the [Getting Started](../getting-started/index.md)
document for all employees of AU and AUH before reading through this
Level 4 specific document.
:::

A warm welcome to you as a new employee here at Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus. 
We are located in beautiful surroundings in Forum, Aarhus University Hospital (AUH).

On level 4 there is laboratory research, as well as office facilities, meeting- and lunchrooms.

In this material you can find answers to a lot of questions regarding SDCA and especially plan 4.

There are both descriptions and attachments.

Inquiries regarding adding other materials in the BRIK Cabinets: contact Henriette Kristoffersen (henrikis@rm.dk).
Other purchases are the responsibility of the individual groups themselves.

## Waste management
In the offices there is a waste bin for paper, which is emptied by the service staff and a bin for residual waste, which you must empty yourself. You can place the residual waste in the waste bin in room A401-172.
- Cardboard boxes are folded and placed in the cage in room A401-172.
- Glass waste is placed in cardboard box with blue garbage bag in room A401-172.

- Plastic is collected for recycling by the following sorting:
    - *Hard plastic non-hazardous* in room lab A401-104, A401-130 and in cell lab A401-122+A401-123 
        - *Hard plastic non-hazardous*, is plastic that has not been in contact with hazardous chemicals or is infectious. For example, bottles for media, PBS, sterile water, pipette boxes, etc. However, bottles must be rinsed before being placed in the waste container and the lid and bottle keep apart.
    - *Hard plastic hazardous* in room A401-172.
        - *Hard plastic hazardous* is hard plastic that has been in contact with hazardous chemistry, however, here there are exceptions. On the waste bin you can be seen which ones are allowed to be put in the waste container. Be aware before putting anything in the container.
    - *Soft plastic non-hazardous* in Lab 401-106, Lab A401-130, as well as room A401-172.
        - Soft plastic is plastic such as bubble wrap, plastic bags, etc.

See also attached guide for Waste Management.

## Chemical waste
A trolley table for chemical waste is located in Room A401-172. 
Pick up MUST be booked before placing the chemical waste.
Instructions are available both on the trolley and attached (only in Danish).
**Pay attention to waste groups!!**
Remember to write what is in the chemical waste container, as well as approximately the amount and waste group. 

## Ordering dry ice
Order via the Purchasing Department (Indkøbsafdelingen), AUH – see attached order form (in Danish). 

## Wet-Ice
You can pick up wet-ice in room A401-128

## Autoclave
There is a small wet autoclave and two dry autoclaves in room A401-166
One dry autoclave is reserved for cell culture bottles etc. and will be started approximately every other day. The second dry autoclave can be used for both sterilization and for "burning" glassware for RNA/DNA work.

## Safety and fire
There is a first aid kit in a locker in “Fællesrummet”.

Spill kits for chemical accidents are available in the two Chemical Rooms (A401-118 and A401- 135).

Fire hose can be found in “Fællesrummet”.

In case of fire, the stairwells act as escape routes, the fire should be kept out of there for min. 2 hours.
All doors are fire-doors and they close automatically upon fire.
All locked doors open so you can get in and out without access cards.
Be aware that ventilation checks of fire dampers are ongoing from 6.00-6.30 every Thursday, which means that fume hood / LAF benches do not work during that period. Therefore, pay attention to what is put in fume Hoods from Wednesday to Thursday.

## Workflow in laboratories
Please note that there may be different rules in the different laboratories on level 4 and you must have a thorough instruction before starting work.
Instructions must be given on:
- Waste management
- Chemical waste
- Glove use
- Washing utensils
- Safety
- Fume Hoods

## Use of laboratory equipment
When using/borrowing other people's equipment, permission must always be asked and there must be thorough instruction in the use, regardless of what is to be borrowed. 
The equipment will be marked with a color system and name of an equipment responsible. 
- Green = Use without asking (e.g. Wet-ice)
- Yellow = Ask responsible person about the possibility of borrowing the equipment. (e.g. EVOS)
- Red = This equipment is not available for use
The individual research groups, at level 4, decide for themselves what colour their own equipment should be.

## Cell Culture Lab
We have 3 Cell Culture Rooms, that are GMO Class I, two at level 4 – room A401-122 and A401-123 and 1 Cell Culture room at J J101-120.

You must be instructed in workflow and GMO rules before you can work in the cell labs.

Attached are GMO safety rules and general rules for cell labs.
