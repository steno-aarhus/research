You must pay to park at AUH. 

## Information regarding parking for RM employees

If you are employed by Central Denmark Region please contact [Inger
Hornbech](mailto:inger.hornbech@rm.dk){.email} if you need a parking
contract at AUH.

## Information regarding parking for AU employees and others
If you are employed by Aarhus University you can buy a parking card for
Aarhus University Hospital (AUH) at a fixed monthly price at APCOA Parking. 
Either by personal inquiry at G306 or by booking via the following guide:

1.  Go to [APCOA's website](https://www.apcoa.dk/index.php?id=5570).
2.  Fill out the [form](https://auh.apcoa.dk/iPCP/contract/create).
3.  You don't need to fill in the registration number of the car. The
    parking card is registered to the person (not the car), so it's
    possible to use the card in another car if needed.
4.  It is also possible to buy an extra parking card (card no. 2), if
    you use different cars, and would like to keep a card in each car.
    The price is 100 DKKR (one-time expense for the extra card).    
5.  If you are not an RM employee, the employee number to be used is: 99999.
