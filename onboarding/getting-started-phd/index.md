Please read through the [Getting Started](../getting-started/index.md)
document for all employees of AU and AUH before reading through this PhD
specific document.
:::

PhD and affiliated students at SDCA have different levels of
affiliations: Some are financially supported and have their main
supervisor at Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, others have a co-supervisor
that is partly affiliated. We aim to be very inclusive, but some
activities will only apply to students with a certain affiliation, e.g.
some staff activities for PhD-students situated locally. If you have any
questions regarding this, please, do not hesitate to get in touch with
Inger Hornbech
([inger.hornbech\@rm.dk](mailto:inger.hornbech@rm.dk){.email}).

## Start-up guide

Regardless of where your affiliation is, you will receive an email from
one of the Research Secretaries with a start-up guide to Steno Diabetes
Center Aarhus. The guide will differ depending on how you are affiliated
with SDCA.

## Communication and social

Slack

:   You might know Slack? That's Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus's social
    media. Here, you will be able to connect with people across SDCA.
    Social and scientific events and lunch pack photos -- it's all there
    under the Channels `#2_forskning` and `#6_events`.

Photos for the SDCA website

:   Affiliated PhD students have profiles on our website: A photo and a
    short description of the PhD project. Our colleague Claus Hastrup
    can help out with the photo, please contact Inger for an appointment
    with Claus, and fill in the project form and return it to
    Inger.

PhD network and facebook

:   SDCA aims to be a research hub for knowledge sharing and networking
    within diabetes related research. As an affiliated PhD student, you
    will enroll in our PhD-network with fellow affiliated PhD students
    with diverse backgrounds. The PhD network provides research and
    networking activities that is tailored towards supporting you during
    your PhD. As a member of the network, you will receive invitations
    and information from time to time.

    For questions related to the PhD network meetings, please contact
    Julie Bondgaard Mortensen at [juliebm@biomed.au.dk](mailto:juliebm@biomed.au.dk){.email}.

    When you end your PhD you will no longer be part of the PhD network,
    but you may choose to join the SDCA Alumni network.

Steno PhD Network Facebook group

:   Informal questions or information related to PhD-students affiliated
    with SDCA may be posted on this group. Join us!

Steno Thursdays

:   This is our weekly, scientific seminar that takes place most
    Thursdays 14:15-15:00 in "Verdensrummet" (auditorium A201-170) in
    Forum. The seminars disseminate diabetes research and provides a
    great platform to learn about research projects at SDCA and discuss
    science.

    Once a month we aim to host a seminar with an international speaker,
    which we call Steno Thursdays Global. You will be notified about
    upcoming Steno Thursdays through e-mail. We value the scientific
    discussion and therefore expect affiliated researchers to prioritize
    these seminars.

Journal clubs

:   Depending on your field of research, it might also be relevant for
    you to join journal clubs or meetings. You will find an overview of
    such activities here on this website. <!-- TODO: add link? -->

SDCA Alumni Network

:   When you end your PhD you will no longer be part of the PhD network,
    but you may choose to join this network. Inger Hornbech will contact
    you about that when time comes.

## Physical access and space at Forum

Office space

:   In Forum we have four offices dedicated to our PhD and affiliated
    students: Two on Plan 3 (clinical research & pregnancy/nutrition
    research) and two on Plan 4 (laboratory research). Most students are
    part-time at Steno, and many desks are therefore shared between
    multiple students. We have written down some office guidelines --
    please read these, when you are allocated to an office -- you'll
    find them on the notice board in the offices. If you need IT
    equipment, please talk to your supervisor (or contact Julie Knudsen
    at [Julie.Knudsen\@rm.dk](mailto:Julie.Knudsen@rm.dk){.email}). If
    you only come to Forum a few times, you might be able to get space,
    but you will need to contact Inger Hornbech.

E-learning

:   ***If*** you have a desk at Forum and are there on a daily basis,
    it's mandatory to participate in the following E-learning courses:

    -   Information security - physical security
    -   Basic Resuscitation, Level 1
    -   Hand hygiene - Break the chain of infection
    -   Fire School.

    You will get an email notification on your RM-mail account with
    guidance to how you conduct the courses. Please notice that the
    courses are held in Danish. If you have any questions related to the
    E-learning courses please contact Inger Hornbech.

Research in Steno's medical research lab

:   If you are to do research in the research lab, there is a [Google
    Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lDdepk2NY-dnNnWQub4AyW05jRmxOnox6H6_gQUah6Q/edit#)
    (in Danish) you can look over.
