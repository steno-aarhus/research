Insurance

:   Employees are covered by both the Consolidated Workers’ Compensation
    Act (Arbejdsskadesikringsloven) and the Consolidated Working
    Environment Act (Arbejdsmiljøloven), when performing a task at their
    place of employment. For this reason, it is important to define when
    a person is considered an "employee". Read more about the
    definitions on
    [STAFF.AU.DK](https://medarbejdere.au.dk/en/administration/hr/recruitment-and-employment/insurance/insurance/)
    or contact [AU HR, Employment
    Law](https://medarbejdere.au.dk/en/administration/overview-of-au-administration/au-hr/employment-law/).

Interns/trainees/visiting students are not covered by AUs or RMs insurance

:   Generally speaking, interns/trainees are **not** covered by the
    Consolidated Workers’ Compensation Act. (However, there are a number
    of exceptions.) Because the starting point is that interns are not
    covered, It is important that the interns themselves clarify with
    their insurance company whether they are already covered during
    their time at SDCA – or if they need to take out an extra insurance
    policy. Please read more about insurance and other aspects of
    international internships on the AU websites: [Student traineeships
    at
    AU](https://international.au.dk/education/admissions/student-traineeships-at-au)
    and [Information for hosts for international
    interns](https://medarbejdere.au.dk/en/administration/international/hosting-student-interns/)
    If you have questions in regard to an internship through Aarhus
    University, please contact the institute you belong to (under AU
    Health) If you have questions in regard to an insternship or another
    affiliation at SDCA, please contact
    [auh.research.stenoaarhus\@rm.dk](mailto:auh.research.stenoaarhus@rm.dk).

MUS talks

:   MUS talks depend on one's terms of employment. Ask Maria Siggaard
    ([marsig\@rm.dk](mailto:marsig@rm.dk){.email}) if you have questions
    regarding this.

## Sick days, holidays, and time off

> Taking days off for being sick, for parental leave, holidays, and any
> other reasons.

Holidays and "omsorgsdage"
