IT software, services, and hardware are all dependent on your location
of employment: Aarhus University or Region Midt. Getting user access is
usually done as part of the employment process. Once you have a user ID,
here are some basic things you might need from IT.

## Institute-specific details

::: panel-tabset
### Aarhus University

Specific support can be found on the [Guides
website](https://medarbejdere.au.dk/en/administration/it/guides) or by
contacting Aarhus University directly on their [contacts
page](https://medarbejdere.au.dk/en/administration/it/main-academic-areas/he-it-support/).
Their guides are all available in either English or Danish.

-   **WiFi**: Accessing internet is done with eduroam. Set up is done
    through their [guide](https://eduroam.au.dk/en/).
-   **VPN**: When working remotely, many university and research
    services are only available by connecting to the university VPN. Use
    their [Setup
    Guide](https://medarbejdere.au.dk/en/administration/it/guides/network/vpn-remoteaudk).
-   **Personal drive**: You can connect and access your personal drive
    from your computer by following these
    [instructions](https://medarbejdere.au.dk/en/administration/it/guides/datastorage/personal-folder-access/).
-   **Shared drive(s)**: If you need access to a shared drive that your
    team or colleagues use, start with first [requesting
    access](https://medarbejdere.au.dk/en/administration/it/guides/datastorage/access-to-shared-folder)
    to it. Once you get it, follow these
    [steps](https://medarbejdere.au.dk/en/administration/it/guides/datastorage/how-to-access-a-shared-folder)
    to access it on your computer.
-   **Email and calendar**: Setting up or accessing your email and
    calender is done by going through their [Email FAQ
    Guide](https://medarbejdere.au.dk/en/administration/it/guides/mail/faq-mail).

### Region Midt

The regional IT infrastructure is designed around the user being connected to the
regional network and working within a virtual workstation (Citrix),
which can be accessed from any computer.
["Citrix"](https://citrix.rm.dk/) is a cloud-based workspace app to
access all Region Midt's IT solutions. If you are using a Region Midt computer, all programs need to be opened through the Citrix app.

**Access**

To access Citrix you need to have a Region ID and log in with your MitID
or scan your access card. If you need help with this, please ask Julie
Knudsen [julie.knudsen\@rm.dk](Julie.knudsen@rm.dk).

If you are working from a computer that does not have Citrix installed, you can get access through [https://citrix.rm.dk/](https://citrix.rm.dk). Read the guide on [how to install Citrix on a personal device](https://regionmidtjylland.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/AUHSTDIC/Afdeling/_F%C3%A6lles/Vejledninger/IT/How%20to%20access%20Citrix%20from%20a%20personal%20device.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=xgQgSz).
For further details about how to gain access from a personal device or outside of the region network, read about [working from home](https://www.medarbejder.rm.dk/hjemmearbejde/) or [remote access](https://intranet.rm.dk/it/it-support/fjernadgang/). 

-   **Personal drives**: Regional employees have a personal OneDrive and a personal drive through "Stifinder" in
    Citrix. Files saved to the personal drive in Citrix are rather difficult to
    access, so we recommend using the OneDrive for personal files.
-   **Shared drives**: SDCA has a regional SharePointsite called [AUHSTDIC](https://regionmidtjylland.sharepoint.com/sites/AUHSTDIC/Afdeling/Forms/AllItems.aspx) and several Teams SharePointsites. 
    It depends on what kind information you need to save and share, whether you should use
    a shared drive or instead use other sources. Ask your research team wich drives they use.
-   **Email and calendar**: You can open your email and calendar either
    through Citrix or [Outlook.com](https://outlook.office.com/mail/).
-   **Office.com**: Access OneDrive, SharePoint, Word, Excel etc. through [office.com](https://www.office.com/login?es=UnauthClick&ru=%2f%3ffromcode%3dcmmiadtp424) by logging in with your region email (regionID@**one**rm.dk) and your region password.

**Printing**

To use the Regional cloud printers you need to install them first:

-   Open 'Indstillinger' (Settings) on your computer and go to 'Bluetooth og enheder' (Bluetooth and devices).
-   Click on 'Printere og scannere'
-   Click the 'Tilføj enhed' ("Add device") button and wait for it to search for network printers ('USB eller netværk'). After a few seconds the option 'Den printer, jeg søger efter, findes ikke på listen' ("The printer that I want isn't listed") will apear beneath.
-   Click on 'Tilføj ny enhed manuelt' (Add new device manually).
-   Choose 'Søg efter en printer i kataloget, baseret på placering eller
    funktion' and click 'Næste' ("Find a printer in the directory,
    based on location or feature") and click 'Næste'.
-   The names of printers at Aarhus University Hospital are prefixed
    `1_`, so enter `1_` in the 'Navn' (Name) field and press Enter
    to find these.
-   Double-click the printer to install it. Your standard printer should be `1_RM_A4_SH` (for A4-size prints in black and white) but you can also add `1_RM_A4_Farve` (for colour prints) or `1_RM_A3_Farve` (for A3-size prints). Click 'Næste' and 'Udført' to complete the
    setup for each printer.
-   Now you can send documents to the printers. The document will be
    physically printed when you log on to one of the printers with your Region ID
    and password or keycard.

**IT support and guides**

You can find [IT support](https://intranet.rm.dk/it/it-support/) and [guides](https://intranet.rm.dk/it/Region-Midtjyllands-it-vejledninger/)
on the Regions intranet. Help, support, documents or other services are almost only available through Citrix.

:::

Regardless of which institution is your administrative employer, if you
work primarily at SDCA, there are a number of helpful template files and
other resources available on the SDCA SharePointsite [AUHSTDIC](https://regionmidtjylland.sharepoint.com/sites/AUHSTDIC/Afdeling/Forms/AllItems.aspx).
You can find relevant ones by asking your colleagues.
