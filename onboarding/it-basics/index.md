IT software, services, and hardware are all dependent on your location
of employment: Aarhus University or Region Midt. Getting user access is
usually done as part of the employment process. Once you have a user ID,
here are some basic things you might need from IT.

## Institute-specific details

::: panel-tabset
### Aarhus University

Specific support can be found on the [Guides
website](https://medarbejdere.au.dk/en/administration/it/guides) or by
contacting Aarhus University directly on their [contacts
page](https://medarbejdere.au.dk/en/administration/it/main-academic-areas/he-it-support/).
Their guides are all available in either English or Danish.

-   **WiFi**: Accessing internet is done with eduroam. Set up is done
    through their [guide](https://eduroam.au.dk/en/).
-   **VPN**: When working remotely, many university and research
    services are only available by connecting to the university VPN. Use
    their [Setup
    Guide](https://medarbejdere.au.dk/en/administration/it/guides/network/vpn-remoteaudk).
-   **Personal drive**: You can connect and access your personal drive
    from your computer by following these
    [instructions](https://medarbejdere.au.dk/en/administration/it/guides/datastorage/personal-folder-access/).
-   **Shared drive(s)**: If you need access to a shared drive that your
    team or colleagues use, start with first [requesting
    access](https://medarbejdere.au.dk/en/administration/it/guides/datastorage/access-to-shared-folder)
    to it. Once you get it, follow these
    [steps](https://medarbejdere.au.dk/en/administration/it/guides/datastorage/how-to-access-a-shared-folder)
    to access it on your computer.
-   **Email and calendar**: Setting up or accessing your email and
    calender is done by going through their [Email FAQ
    Guide](https://medarbejdere.au.dk/en/administration/it/guides/mail/faq-mail).

### Region Midt

Region Midt uses the cloud based [“Citrix”](https://citrix.rm.dk/) workspace app to access all their IT solutions. You can find [IT support](https://intranet.rm.dk/it/it-support/) and [guides](https://intranet.rm.dk/it/Region-Midtjyllands-it-vejledninger/) on the Regions intranet. Help, support, documents or other services are also almost only available through Citrix.

To access Citrix you need to have a Region ID and log in with your MitID or scan your access card. If you need help with this, please ask Julie Knudsen [julie.knudsen@rm.dk](Julie.knudsen@rm.dk).
If you are using a Region Midt computer, all programs need to be opened through the Citrix app. If you are working from another computer, you can get access through [https://citrix.rm.dk/](https://citrix.rm.dk).

-   **Personal drives**: Accessed by searching for "Stifinder" in Citrix. Files saved to the Region personal drive are difficult to
    access outside of Citrix and can't easily be shared with others
    who do not have a Region ID. So we do not recommend using the
    Region drives unless it is highly sensitive
    information. Data should instead be saved on shared drives or through other appropriate sources (depends on your
    research team).
-   **Shared drives**: Accessed by searching for "Stifinder Afdeling" in
    Citrix. Like with the personal drive above, it depends on what kind of information you need to
    save and share, whether you should use the shared drive or instead use other sources (like
    GitHub or the Aarhus University shared drives).
-   **Email and calendar**: You can open your email and calendar either
    through Citrix or by using [`post.rm.dk`](https://post.rm.dk/).
:::

Regardless of which institution is your administrative employer, if you
work primarily at SDCA, there are a number of helpful template files and
other resources found only in Citrix (by searching for "Stifinder
Afdeling"). We hope to slowly make these files more easily available,
but until then, you can find relevant ones by asking your colleagues.
