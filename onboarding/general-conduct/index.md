## Expected Behavior

We treat each other with respect and courtesy, whether it be online or
in-person. In order to foster trust, a positive and professional
learning environment, strengthen collaboration and contribute to a
positive working environment, we encourage the following kinds of
behaviours in all interactions:

-   Show courtesy and respect towards others.
-   Be kind and aware of your words.
-   Use welcoming and inclusive language.
-   Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences.
-   Gracefully accept constructive criticism.
-   Focus on what is best for the community overall.

Read the ["four social
rules"](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) for further
recommendations and details on proper behaviour. These rules are more
lightweight, and we have all broken them, which is why awareness is
important. A sincere apology for breaking these rules goes a long way.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to:

-   Written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people
    on the basis of membership of any specific group.
-   Causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking,
    following, or intimidation.
-   Violent threats or language directed against another person.
-   Displays of sexual or violent images.
-   Unwelcome sexual attention.
-   Non-consensual or unwelcome physical contact.
-   Sustained disruption of talks, events, or communications.
-   Insults or put-downs.
-   Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary
    jokes.
-   Excessive swearing.
-   Incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm.
-   Continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or
    recording) with someone after being asked to stop.
-   Publication of private communication without consent.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

If you are not comfortable confronting the violator yourself, either
privately or in public, seek help from peers and/or supervisor(s) you
trust.
