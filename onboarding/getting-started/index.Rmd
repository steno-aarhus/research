## Welcome!!

We have high ambitions at SDCA. We believe that people with diabetes can
have a good life. We will make a difference to all people with or at
risk of getting diabetes in Central Denmark Region.

As a new member of our research team, there is a lot of things you need
learn about the organization, the culture (both research and social) and
a lot of practical stuff. The page here is thought of as your initial
entry point, where you can get an overview. This is also an atlas for
you to return to when you need to look up specific information.

To get an introduction to the research team and this document you will
be teamed up with an experienced member from research. It is your
supervisor's responsibility to find you a "buddy." Please ask your
supervisor if this is not already in place.

Your buddy will walk you through the relevant tables below and give you
an overview of all the topics that you need to be aware of. The agenda
for the meeting is:

1.  Introduce yourselves
2.  Go through the table below
3.  Take a tour around the research facility
4.  Arrange follow-up talk

The purpose of the follow-up talk is to catch up on how you have settled
in. If you have any specific questions you can also ask them. As the
final thing, you and your buddy will evaluate the introduction. You will
be given responsibility to update this website if you have encountered
any information that was not up to date and you should add any other
information you would have liked the page to contain. This is a very
important step because it ensures that this material is always current
and helps the next new team member.

## PhD students

### Different affiliations
PhD and affiliated students at SDCA have different levels of affiliations: Some are financially supported and have their main supervisor at Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, others have a co-supervisor partly affiliated. We aim to be very inclusive, but some activities will only apply to students with a certain affiliation, e.g. some staff activities for PhD-students situated locally. If you have any questions regarding this, please, do not hesitate to get in touch with Inger Hornbech (inger.hornbech@rm.dk).

### Start-up guide
You will recieve an email from one of the Research Secretaries with a Start-up guide to Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus. The guide will differ depending on how you are affiliated with SDCA.

### PhD network and facebook
SDCA aims to be a research hub for knowledge sharing and networking within diabetes related research. As an affiliated PhD student, you will enroll in our PhD-network with fellow affiliated PhD students with diverse backgrounds. The PhD network provides research and networking activities that is tailored towards supporting you during your PhD. As a member of the network, you will receive invitations and information from time to time. 

Informal questions or information related to PhD-students affiliated with SDCA may be posted on the Facebook group “Steno PhD Network”. Join us!

When you end your PhD you will no longer be part of the PhD network, but you may choose to join the SDCA Alumni network. Inger Hornbech will contact you about that when time comes.

For questions related to the PhD network meetings, please contact Ole Emil Andersen (oleemil@clin.au.dk).

### Slack
You might know Slack? That’s Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus's social media. Here, you will be able to connect with people across SDCA. Social and scientific events and lunch pack photos – it’s all there (posted under 2_Forskning-og-udd and 6_Events).

### Steno Thursdays and journal clubs
Steno Thursdays – that’s our weekly, scientific seminar that takes place most Thursdays 14:15-15:00 at ""Verdensrummet"" (auditorium A201-170) in FORUM. The seminars disseminate diabetes research and provides a great platform to learn about research projects at SDCA and discuss science. Once a month we aim to host a seminar with an international speaker; this we call Steno Thursdays Global. You will be notified about upcoming Steno Thursdays through e-mail.
We value the scientific discussion and therefore expect affiliated researchers to prioritize these seminars.

Depending on your field of research, it might also be relevant for you to join journal clubs or meetings. You will find an overview of such activities here.

### SDCA website
Affiliated PhD students have profiles on our website: A photo and a short description of the PhD project.
