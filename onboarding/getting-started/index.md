## Welcome!

We have high ambitions at SDCA. We believe that people with diabetes can
have a good life. And our aim is, through our research, to improve life
for all people with or at risk of getting diabetes in Central Region
Denmark.

As a new member of our research team, there is a lot of things you need
learn about the organization, the culture (both research and social) and
a lot of practical stuff. The page here is thought of as your initial
entry point, where you can get an overview. This is also an atlas for
you to return to when you need to look up specific information.

To get an introduction to the research team and this document you will
be teamed up with an experienced member from research. It is your
supervisor's responsibility to find you a "buddy." Please ask your
supervisor if this is not already in place.

Your buddy will walk you through the relevant tables below and give you
an overview of all the topics that you need to be aware of. The agenda
for the meeting is:

1.  Introduce yourselves
2.  Go through the table below
3.  Take a tour around the research facility
4.  Arrange follow-up talk

The purpose of the follow-up talk is to catch up on how you have settled
in. If you have any specific questions you can also ask them. As the
final thing, you and your buddy will evaluate the introduction. You will
be given responsibility to update this website if you have encountered
any information that was not up to date and you should add any other
information you would have liked the page to contain. This is a very
important step because it ensures that this material is always current
and helps the next new team member.

Read through this website, especially the "Onboarding" section, which is
targeted to new employees. If you have a question that isn't answered
here, open an
[Issue](https://github.com/steno-aarhus/research/issues/new) (needs a
[GitHub](https://github.com/join) account) to let us know that we need
to add this information. Then email either Inger Hornbech
([inger.hornbech\@rm.dk](mailto:inger.hornbech@rm.dk){.email}) or Julie
Knudsen ([julie.knudsen\@rm.dk](mailto:julie.knudsen@rm.dk){.email}) to
get your question (hopefully) answered.

## Getting started

At the very least, you will probably need to get an **access/ID card**
for entering AUH and Forum.

-   If you have an RM ID-card: You can get access to SDCA by emailing
    your User ID to Inger Hornbech or Julie Knudsen.
-   If you don't have an RM ID-card: Inger or Julie will need your CPR
    number and after that you will need to visit the card administration
    to have a photo taken, which is at Plan 1, Universitetstorvet i
    Nord, Krydspunkt 110, room J116-106. Opening hours are Mon to Fri
    from 07.30-09.30 & 10.00-12.00. Remember to bring photo ID (e.g.
    driver's license).

## Employment

If you have questions about your salary or contract, its best to ask
whoever administers yours or your supervisor's grants. That would be
Maria Siggaard ([marsig\@rm.dk](mailto:marsig@rm.dk){.email}) if
employment is at RM or Charlotte Rosholm
