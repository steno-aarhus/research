## Welcome!

We have high ambitions at SDCA. We believe that people with diabetes can
have a good life. And our aim is, through our research, to improve life
for all people with or at risk of getting diabetes in Central Region
Denmark.

As a new member of our research team, there is a lot of things you need
learn about the organization, the culture (both research and social) and
a lot of practical stuff. This website is thought of as your initial
entry point, where you can get an overview.
The website is also an atlas for
you to return to when you need to look up specific information.

## Getting started

To give an introduction to the research team and the onboarding documents some supervisors team up new employees with an experienced member from research - a "buddy".
Other supervisors choose to give the introduction themselves.
It is your supervisor's responsibility to find you a "buddy", if they are not available to give the introduction themselves. Please ask your
supervisor about it if you have further questions.

### Onboarding

Either your supervisor or your "buddy" will walk you through the relevant onboarding pages and give you
an overview of the topics that you need to be aware of.

We suggest that you use this agenda for the onboarding:

1.  Introduce yourselves
2.  Go through the onboarding pages and give an overview of where to find other relevant information
3.  Take a tour around the research facility
4.  Arrange a follow-up talk

The purpose of the follow-up talk is to catch up on how you have settled
in. If you have any specific questions you can also ask them. As the
final thing, we encourage you to evaluate the introduction. 

### Help us keep the information up to date

It is your responsibility to update this website if you have encountered
any information that was not up to date and you should add any other
information you would have liked the page to contain. This is a very
important step because it ensures that this material is always current
and helps the next new team member.

There are [instructions for how to contribute](/CONTRIBUTING.md) available under the Contributing tab.

Read through this website, especially the "Onboarding" section, which is
targeted to new employees. If you have a question that isn't answered
here, open an
[Issue](https://github.com/steno-aarhus/research/issues/new) (needs a
[GitHub](https://github.com/join) account) to let us know that we need
to add this information. Then email either Inger Hornbech
([inger.hornbech\@rm.dk](mailto:inger.hornbech@rm.dk){.email}) or Julie
Knudsen ([julie.knudsen\@rm.dk](mailto:julie.knudsen@rm.dk){.email}) to
get your question (hopefully) answered.

### Access to Forum

At the very least, you will probably need to get an **access/ID card**
for entering AUH and Forum.

-   If you have an RM ID-card: You can get access to SDCA by emailing
    your User ID to Inger Hornbech or Julie Knudsen.
-   If you don't have an RM ID-card: Inger or Julie will need your CPR
    number and after that you will need to visit the card administration
    to have a photo taken, which is at Plan 1, Universitetstorvet i
    Nord, Krydspunkt 110, room J116-106. Opening hours are Mon to Fri
    from 07.30-09.30 & 10.00-12.00. Remember to bring photo ID (e.g.
    driver's license).

## Employment

If you have questions about your salary or contract, its best to ask
whoever administers yours or your supervisor's grants. That would be
Maria Siggaard ([marsig\@rm.dk](mailto:marsig@rm.dk){.email}) if
employment is at RM or Charlotte Rosholm ([cro\@clin.au.dk](mailto:cro@clin.au.dk){.email}) or Henriette Jaquet
Harrit ([henriette.jaquet\@clin.au.dk](mailto:henriette.jaquet@clin.au.dk){.email})
if employment is at AU.
