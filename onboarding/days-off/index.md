Calling in sick for yourself or a dependent (like your child)

:   Sick days are generally very easy to ask for, though does depend on
    your terms of employment. For PhD students, email your supervisor.

    registration if you have an RM employment or Charlotte Rosholm

    you are employed at AU. Ultimately, contact whoever administers
    yours or your supervisor's grants.

Holidays and "omsorgsdage"

:   The exact amount of holidays and time off you get depend on your
    terms of employment. For PhD students email your supervisor. For
    postdocs and other researchers in SDCA, email Inger Hornbech for
    registration if you have an RM employment or Charlotte Rosholm or Henriette Jaquet if you have an AU employment.

Maternity/paternity leave and other leaves
