There are some terms used in the video:

-   **Repository**: A
    [repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repositories)
    is everything that is contained within the project. In this case,
    the repository is the website with the \[Issues\], files, and
    subfolders for this project.
-   **Issue**: An [Issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) is
    a task or to-do item that needs to be completed. These to-do items
    can be assigned to people and can be checked off as being done
    ("Closed").
-   **Branch**: A
    [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#branch)
    is a separate, parallel set of files and folders related to the
    project. In this project there is the "main" branch that only the
    admin can edit. In order to add content to the main branch, you need
    to create your own branch and create a [pull
    request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
    of your changes and additions that you want added to the main files.
    Branches and pull requests are heavily used in the "[GitHub
    workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)" that this
    project (and many many others) use. More details about this are in
    the next section and video. Branches are in some ways like separate
    files that you would email between other contributors, but instead
    of everyone having different versions of the file, here they are all
    contained in the same place (in the repository).
-   **Pull request**: A [pull
    request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
    is a request to add changes you've made to files in your branch and
    have them put into the main branch. When you make a pull request, it
    allows others to review what you've changed and make comments on it.
    Think of it like "Track changes" and the "Add comment" features of
    Word.
