  A quick, step-by-step guide to contributing by using GitHub.
---

In SDCA Research we use GitHub for common docs and support. This is a
quick guide to write your first (or second) content and contribute to
the community. Please be aware that everything on GitHub is **open
access**, so don't add anything private or confidential.

## First time logging in

1.  [Sign up](https://github.com/join) for a GitHub account if you don't
    have one already.

2.  Go to the SDCA Research GitHub
    [repository](https://github.com/steno-aarhus/research/).

    ![SDCA GitHub main
    page.](../images/sdca-repo.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of part of the SDCA Research GitHub repository."}

3.  Send your username to administrator Luke Johnston so he can add you
    as a team member.

4.  You'll receive an invitation mail. Join
    [\@steno-aarhus](https://github.com/steno-aarhus) through the link
    (expires in 7 days)

5.  Watch [tutorial videos](../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## How to contribute?

1.  Create a new (personal) branch[^1] to work in, since you can't
    directly edit the files in the "main" branch. (You need to be added
    as a teammember to complete this step)

[^1]: A branch is a bit like a "copy" of the files in the "main" branch.
    After you edit the files in the "copy" (branch), you can request
    your changes get included into the main branch.

branch.](../images/create-new-branch.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of creating a new branch on the SDCA Research GitHub page."}

2.  If you want to add a new file, rather than modify and existing one,
    go to "Create new file":

![Adding a new file to your personal
branch.](../images/add-new-file.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of adding a new file to the SDCA Research GitHub page."}

3.  Give your file a name, for instance `guide-to-github.md` (only small
    characters and use `-` for spaces). Use `.md` as the file extension,
    which stands for "Markdown".

file.](../images/naming-new-file.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of naming the new file on the SDCA Research GitHub page."}

4.  Start writing your content in Markdown. You can find support on how
    to write using Markdown in this [tutorial](writing-markdown.md).

5.  In order to save your changes you've made, you need to 'commit'[^2]
    this new file to the Git history and eventually on to the website.
    At the bottom of the page is a text box to write a message. Please
    write a short message describing why you are adding the files or
    making the changes.

[^2]: "Commit" means to save something to the history, like you "commit"
    something to your memory.

history.](../images/commit-new-file.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of committing the new file to the Git history on the SDCA Research GitHub page."}

6.  Now you can find your file in the research folder on your personal
    branch. You can continue writing either on this file or others by
    clicking the 'Edit' button of the file.

repository.](../images/new-file-in-history.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of the newly committed file in the Git repository history on the SDCA Research GitHub page."}

![Editing the newly created file, or other
files.](../images/editing-file.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of editing the newly created file in the Git repository history on the SDCA Research GitHub page."}

7.  Once you are finished with what you want to add or modify, the next
    step is to get the content on the website. To do that, you'll need
    to make a "pull request"[^3] so that your content gets merged into
    the main branch. Go to 'Code', choose your personal branch, click
    'Contribute' and 'Open pull request'.

[^3]: A pull request is a process of taking your branch and requesting
    that it get merged into the main branch. It also allows for people
    to comment on your changes before they get merged.

![Creating a pull
request.](../images/create-pull-request.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of creating a pull request on the SDCA Research GitHub page."}

8.  Once you've selected to make a pull request of your branch, you need
    to write a title describing what you are adding or changing and why.
    Then you can click 'Create pull request.'. The administrator will
    look at the pull request and if necessary, add some edits before
    adding it to the main branch/webpage. Everyone can comment with
    suggestion for change.

![Finish with submitting the pull
request.](../images/submit-pull-request.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of submitting a pull request on the SDCA Research GitHub page."}

And that's the basics!
