  Basic principles we follow for contributing to the Common Docs.

In order to ensure that we get the most from creating these documents
and that we don't spend more time on this than is necessary (given it is
largely a secondary task and activity to our collective research
responsibilities), here are some principles to guide our decisions and
activity on what documents get created:

1.  **All are welcome to contribute**: There should be no or little
    barrier to contributing to the documents and their content, aside
    from barriers due to technology and skill in its use. If someone has
    the motivation and desire to contribute, they should be able to do
    so fairly easily.

2.  **Inclusion and participation in community through active
    contribution**: Individuals who want to participate should actively
    contribute through not just attending meetings, but also in
    creating, modifying, organizing, editing, and/or developing the
    content on the website. Those who actively contribute should be
    included in the community and encouraged to participate.

3.  **Content is dictated by direct and active contribution**: What gets
    created or developed should be done by whoever contributes to
    creating or building it. If someone wants or requests something to
    be created or modified, they are encouraged and given the power to
    do so themselves. In combination with the first principle, the
    barrier to contributing is only dependent on learning the basic
    technical and writing skills rather than any administrative barrier
    such as "requiring permission". If you want something, than you are
    free to make it! We create and add content to the website based on
    what we personally want or are motivated to do, rather than what we
    are told to do[^1].

4.  **Important or significant decisions are based on community
    consensus**: Decisions should not or need not be blocked by
    requiring permission from anything external to the community. This
    ensures things move forward as continuously and unrestricted as
    possible. Important or significant decisions could include things
    like approving and finalizing a document or deciding on major
    infrastructural changes (e.g. platform to use for creating and
    managing the content).

[^1]: ...though we recognize that sometimes we must do things we are
    told to do.
