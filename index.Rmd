# Purpose

There are a few purposes for this website:

1. We want this to be an "entry point" for newcomers to SDCA to use in getting
started, to learning the culture at SDCA, how to do common tasks, and generally
getting help overall.
2. This is a way for us to explicitly describe the research culture so we can
more easily collaborate with, get help from, and generally support each other.
3. To begin documenting how to do things so others can learn and benefit from
our experiences, and so that we can make use of others' experiences and knowledge.

# About us

We are a group of researchers working within the Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus. 
Our research spans multiple fields, all of which are tied by the study of
diabetes.
