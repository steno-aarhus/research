## Denmark Statistics

Some more details about applying to Denmark Statistics can be found on the official 
[SDCA website](https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/research/resources/register-based-research/).

On this page are some more personal experiences of applying for data from DST.
As a non-Danish speaking researcher, this was quite difficult since much of the
documentation and help is in Danish. Plus, there are slight differences between
the English version and the Danish. Of course, the Danish version is the most
accurate, but it is not obvious where and if there are differences.

### Example of successful application

Myself and several others applied to DST. Below are links to
