If you need to print a poster, which service you use depends on where
your funding comes from.

-   For AU funding, use their [Printing
    Service](http://www.trykkeri.au.dk/en/).
-   For AUH funding, use their [Grafisk
    Service](http://auh.intranet.rm.dk/hjalp-til/kommunikation/grafik-og-layout/)
    (this is only viewable through the
    ["Citrixportal"](https://citrixportal.rm.dk) or if you are connected
    to the AUH network).
