If you need to preregister a research project based on observational
data online to be able to upload an analysis plan, analysis code, or
other files or pre-defined plans, you can do it at Open Science
Framework (OSF): [OSF Registries](https://osf.io/registries/). If
instead you are looking to register a clinical trial you should go to
[clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) – here we only
consider OSF registrations. After registering at OSF, you can upload
results and preprints if necessary as well as other things. In this way,
OSF can be thought of as a public logbook for your research project.

## Introduction and overview of OSF

To get an overview of OSF Registries, you can read more about the
possibilities and how to create an account here (including videos with
help and instructions): [OSF Support](https://help.osf.io/)

Support](https://help.osf.io/article/330-welcome-to-registrations)

## Creating a preregistration at OSF

First step for a preregistration is to select a template. You can read
more about the different templates here: [Select a Registration
Template - OSF
Support](https://help.osf.io/article/229-select-a-registration-template)

The general template “OSF Preregistration” will work for many projects.
The template “Secondary Data Preregistration” is also useful, when data
have previously been collected for other purposes.

When making a preregistration, you can select a copyright license for
the project. Other projects have previously used “CC-By Attribution 4.0
International”. With this license, others can use and refer to the
content in the registration, as long as they credit/reference the
original work. Read more about licensing here: [Licensing - OSF
Support](https://help.osf.io/article/148-licensing)

a project based at Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus consider the following:
