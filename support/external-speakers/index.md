## Payment of external parties for presentations, seminars, workshops etc.
When an external party gives a presentation at a meeting, course or workshop that SDCA is responsible for, the external party can receive different kinds of compensation for their contribution. The compensation can be in the form of a sum of money or a gift. 

### Amount of money
Region Midtjylland has no fixed rates for these payments. The amount must be considered each time and determined by the immediate manager in the unit.

### Gifts
It is also possible to give a gift instead of paying a fee. There is a guideline regarding gift purchases at AUH with an **amount limit of 400 DKK**.
SDCA has a supply of gifts that are within the amount limit. You can collect these from one of the secretaries, who will register the occasion and the name of the person.

### You must be aware of the following matters before you enter into an agreement on a fee or gift:
- **Task performed as part of employment:**
When an employee at AUH performs a task at or for SDCA (e.g. teaching), work performed in/for their own department will be part of the employment and one's normal salary. There will therefore be no remuneration for the employee.
- **Task performed not as part of employment:**
If the work is carried out in the employeeâ€™s spare time, it must be clarified - either by the department management or by the management in SDCA, whether the work is covered by the salary conditions in the department.
- **Practitioners have a fixed consultancy fee**, which is paid on an hourly basis. The rate is adjusted twice a year; on 1 April and 1 October. Per 1 October 2024, the hourly rate is 1.067,37 DKK. Contact PLO at plo.midtjylland@dadl.dk for the latest rate.

If there are circumstances that you think challenge the above rules, you must contact your manager for clarification.

### How do we make payments to external parties?
- **External parties/companies with a CVR number:** must send an invoice to the relevant EAN number.
- **External private persons:** must send an invoice through Virk.dk. Private persons can use their MitID to create and send an invoice via www.virk.dk. For instructions on how to use Virk.dk please contact Inger Hornbech or Julie Knudsen.

The SDCA employee responsible for the event must inform the external party of the relevant EAN number and CVR. No. (29762929) to send the invoice to.

Payment of fees to companies and private individuals is taxable and is reported to SKAT by our accounting department. This concerns both milage allowances and fees for a service purchased by SDCA.
