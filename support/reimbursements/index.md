# Procedures for reimbursement of transport and other expenses
Forhold omkring tjenesterejser, mødebefordring, kurser, uddannelse m.v. - AUH intranet (rm.dk) (Conditions around business trips, transport to meetings, courses, training, etc.)

## Persons with paid employment via Region Midtjylland
Expenses related to driving to and from meetings must be created by the user themselves via the "MinLøn" app on their phone. NOTE: receipts must be attached as pictures.
Indberetning af befordring i kørselsapp (Min Løn Kørsel og Min Løn Udlæg) - Medarbejder.rm.dk (guide to the app – in Danish)
If it concerns other expenses (such as meals or accommodation), the user (or secretary) must fill in the form " Refusion af udlæg øvrige og kursus", which is on the AUH Intranet under the tab "Min side".
Link to instructions: to be added

## Persons with unpaid employment at RM (region ID)
Both driving and other expenses are created via the form on My page. Either by the user or a secretary.

## Other external parties (such as speakers)
Suppliers can create an invoice through virk.dk.
A secretary can create a form on behalf of external parties via "min side". It requires that you have the person's CPR number. And it is important to write under "Bemærkning" that the person is external.

## Foreigners without a CPR number
Contact Julie Knudsen or Inger Hornbech. They will create a profile for the person in the system so that it will be possible to fill in the form on "Min side".
