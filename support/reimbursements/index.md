If you are employed by AUH, you can read about the [conditions around
business trips, transport to meetings, courses, training,
etc.](https://auh.intranet.rm.dk/personale/kursus-tjenesterejser-og-moeder/)

## Persons with paid employment via Region Midtjylland

Reimbursements of expenses related to driving to and from meetings (including parking and ferry ticket) must
be created by the user themselves via the "MinLøn" app on their phone.

Guide to the app (in Danish): [Indberetning i MinLøn appen -

Reimbusements of other expenses such as plane tickets, bus tickets,
meals or accommodation, must be done through the digital form
