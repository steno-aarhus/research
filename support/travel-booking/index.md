## On AU funds

### Booking of flights for you or an external visitor -- 3 options

1.  Book by CWT online tool: [www.mycwt.com](https://www.mycwt.com/)
    (service fee of 14 DKK added per booking).

2.  Book by calling or mailing CWT -- phone: 3363 7744 or
    [au.dk\@contactcwt.com](mailto:au.dk@contactcwt.com){.email}.
    Service fee is based on flight destination:

    -   Within Scandinavian countries: 30 DKK
    -   Within European countries: 60 DKK
    -   Outside of Europe: 150 DKK

3.  Book on the airline company's webpage directly (no service fee, but
    you must also include all your personal data, which is included in
    your CWT profile).

::: callout-note
The service fee for CWT results in two MasterCard transactions for every
booking -- one for e.g., flight cost and one for the service fee.
:::

::: callout-warning
**Bookings for non-AU employees** cannot be handled in the CWT online
platform, so please use the airline company's webpage. Remember that the
same travel rules apply as for AU employees.
