1.  Book by CWT online tool: [www.mycwt.com](https://www.mycwt.com/)
    (service fee of 14 DKK added per booking).

2.  Book by calling or mailing CWT -- phone: 3363 7744 or
    [au.dk\@contactcwt.com](mailto:au.dk@contactcwt.com){.email}
    (service fee: flights in Scandian: 30 DKK, Flights Europe: 60 DKK,
    Flights Intercontinental: 150 DKK).

3.  Book on the airline company's webpage directly (no service fee, but
    you must also include all your personal data, which is included in
    your CWT profile).

Please note: Service fee for CWT mentioned here so you know that there
will be two Mastercard transactions for every booking -- one for e.g.,
flight cost and one for the service fee.

**Bookings for non-AU employees** cannot be handled in the CWT online
platform, so please use the airline company's webpage. Remember that the
same travel rules apply as for AU employees.
