There are several sites to that list sources of funding:

-   [Research
    professional](https://www.researchprofessional.com/sso/login?service=https://www.researchprofessional.com/0/):
    If employed through AU, one has access to Research Profession, which
    is a register that collects information on various funding sources
    for many different purposes.
-   [Steno Collaborative
    Grants](https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/research/steno-collaborative-grants/)
-   [DDEA PhD and postdoc](https://ddeacademy.dk/grants) grants.

## Grant applications

When you apply for a grant, please be aware whether the grant should be administered at Aarhus University or at Aarhus University Hospital. You have to be very specific about this in the application.

If you need inspiration (an overview) for a budget, you can ask:

- [Charlotte Rosholm](mailto:cro@clin.au.dk){.email}
- [Helle Thomassen Bonnesen](mailto:hellbonn@rm.dk){.email}

If you need further guidance, they will go through your budget provided that you have a fairly finished draft.
